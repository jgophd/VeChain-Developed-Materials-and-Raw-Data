Hi everyone, we're back with a with a V chain, the V chain research. Today we have Muhammad Muhammad, can you introduce yourself to let everyone know what you do with an Essbase?

Yeah, actually, thank you for having me in school my name is Mohan Jimmy and I am an intrapreneur in the climate space, having a financial and economic background, with the with an experience in the blockchain industry intrapreneurship. For the last six years, I started my career as a chartered accountant in the financial industry. And back in 2016, when I understood that more radical adjustment needs to be done to vote to the financial industry and I was having certain ideas around circular economy and like different new paradigms that were introduced. With a for the Industrial Revolution, I would say. And by that time, I had the chance to find my first white paper, and to take part of the the 3d conference in Paris. And I fell in love with decentralized technologies and in general, quit my job and went for an entrepreneurship journey around web three, built the first startup in Paris Allawi peer to peer energy trading, and tokenizing carbon credits. At that time, it's called latency. And we created the currency backed by renewable energy. Back in 2020, I co founded a company in Tunisia called Data blockchain house of blockchain, which would, she's positioned as the blockchain hub in North Africa. And since last year, I went with my two co founders, and with you on a very exciting new journey around the project called Hero. And it's a platform to connect citizen around the world to climate mobilizers working on policy change, to provide climate mobilizers a basic income, so they can go full time on what we consider being the most important job of our time. The hero platform is built on web two today, using still using the blockchain technology for for many addressability, and for voting on the platform. But we are still going on web two model currently. Excellent, thanks

03:21
for that. So So given that you have given that you have experienced in working with individuals in Paris and North Africa, you know, I'm still I'm in the US. You know, I know that there are some people in the US that that are a little bit hesitant in adopting, you know, these technologies, because I feel that, you know, Blockchain is linked to crypto and things like that. Right. So So I guess my first question is going to be what has been the response from people within the Paris region and North Africa region? Yeah,

03:53
actually, this is something that I came up to, as well, after a few years of the upgrade experience in the web industry. And as much as they believe it's decentralization is the future and I would say it's already running today. It's already happening. It's not even an illusion. And it's a deep belief that the swing for web three is already on the way. I still see some resistance in adoption. From the mainstream, unfortunately, due to lack of information due to scepticism and risk adversity, and this is one of the reasons we decided to build here on the web to model today. Validate to validate the value proposition strengthen the community around The real value prop and and then adapt the model with the market trend toward the distant towards full decentralization and use in the web re architecture.

05:22
Okay, sounds good. Sounds good. So based on based on the work that you're doing based on the work that you're doing, Ken, what are some of the words some of the things that people can do to successfully implement sustainability efforts on the blockchain?

05:47
I think the incentives is to validate the solution and intrapreneur is bringing to a very specific pain wherever it's been built on a blockchain or not. The blockchain is a technology is a technology layer that can be used for to secure the network to ensure the traceability and transparency of the system. But it shouldn't be on the front of what is being met.

06:30
Interesting, interesting. So So Can you can you kind of expand on what what you've seen others have been building have been building in web three and in blockchain and collaborations. I know that you're that you work a little bit with a Zillow, Zillow, Blockchain, a

06:48
lot of projects are being built on on the cellular network, and other networks as well, from mauler to source to stack the cielo to can. And it's between defy Rifai. Mainly, this is the main guideline that the cielo blockchain decided to position itself in the blockchain industry. And as much as a lot of these solutions are today, like functional and you can already use them on if you have valora. App, as much as I believe it's just to scope it in a small niche that can be enhanced and enlarged with massive adoption. So developers can add the new layers of features that can benefit the user.

08:00
Excellent. So So yeah, thank you. I also want to know one more question. So you mentioned you mentioned that you'd been you've been dealing with with policy change, and some in some areas, so what what have what has been the response with the with the policymakers and the regulators? And also, what's been the, what's been the process of educating them, you know, within within this within this process, and these tools and these technologies.

08:34
Personally, what we are building with Hiro around policy change is policy change for the climate space, not for the blockchain or crypto regulation. And for both cases are facing an inclusive approach to citizen in order to it starts I would say, with a decentralized communication, decentralized glue, and then comes decentralized finance. But the basic layer should be a decentralized conversation that needs to happen between the different stakeholders between citizen policymakers and organizations and different types of organizations before cannon up to a decentralized low that doesn't go top down, but will work more horizontal way and engage both or multiple stakeholders and the reduction of this decentralized low end being implemented either in smart contracts or a different calendar of agreement that can produce the the agreement, I think, the next one secured decentral Well as the agreement, we can go then to a decentralized finance component and, and creating value out of this agreement.

10:12
Excellent. I appreciate that. So thank you for your time today. My hard work and where can people find you?

10:19
Actually, you can find me on LinkedIn. It's my Twitter, both of them on LinkedIn, I think is my most used social network.

10:32
All right. So once again, thank you for your time and everyone else. Until next time, thanks.
