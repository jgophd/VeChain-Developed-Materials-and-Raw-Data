Absolutely. Thanks for having me on. I love supply chain, it's my most favorite topic within their inventory is is a near and dear to my heart topic. And I hear we get to talk about that a little bit today. What I do during the day, I work at a company called Genpact, I'm their global supply chain sustainability, lead, and nights, weekends, afternoons, I lead a nonprofit called a circular supply chain network. I'm also for fun pursuing my doctorate in trying to figure out the relationship between supply chain and the economy. Eight years from now, I should know the answer. So I'll report back then.

00:55
Yeah, we didn't talk about that went blind. Yeah, so. So I know, I know. You know, we've we've had our we've had our conversations in previous interviews about about, you know, blockchain and sustainability and the and the things that come up in the industry. So can you kind of share your thoughts in terms of, you know, if you think that it was, Do you think that organizations would adopt the tracking of carbon emissions on the blockchain? And also, do you even think it's feasible? Oh,

01:32
I would not advise them to do so. And I think it's feasible, but I don't think it's the best solution. And I'll unpack that a little bit. I know in your supply chain era, you're blockchain skeptic. I think the blockchain technology is a remarkable thing for digital assets. It was originally invented to track digital assets in the form of currency tokens. When translated to the physical world, we have some misalignment of problems that we're trying to solve. I think blockchain fundamentally helps to resolve chain of custody, understanding what is the truth, and democratization of whatever it is that we're trying to track. Fantastic. Those are not normally the shortlist of problems that supply chains have in trying to track something through a network. So I don't think it's actually the right tool to solve this problem. And we can unpack the problem in a little bit. But that's one challenge I'm seeing. The second challenge is that we don't have an accepted. It's not like the blockchain, just like there's no such thing as the cloud. There's a blockchain just like a cloud exists out in the world. So we're starting to see cross chain providers to try to get blockchain to talk to each other. I'm seeing hesitancy from one supply chain, oh, I don't want to be on their blockchain. So until we get this market figured out, I think ultimately, maybe a regulatory body from the US or EU or government will issue this is the blockchain to use for track and trace on this food or pharmaceutical or something like this. But for now, there's not a blockchain. And so there's, you do all this work to do a pilot on one blockchain type. And it turns out the same problem we had with the control towers, everybody's on a different version. So that part is hard. The third challenge, which is being actively worked on, I will acknowledge is that blockchain tends to be extremely energy, heavy, energy intensive. And I have not done the math on this. But I could suppose that depending on what you're tracking, you're going to end up expending more carbon for the energy just to fuel the validation of your data, then the thing that you're actually trying to track to begin with, so you end up sort of at a negative result to your problem. So those are the three big challenges, we can certainly unpack why carbon tracing is already difficult. But those are my couple of challenges. I would love to be challenged on me. I will change my mind if I hear good argument.

04:17
Now, you know, you know, you know, I'm a blockchain. Maxie and you put some good points, you know, you know, you did a good job if you shut me up.

04:29
So, I want to I want to expand on that. And I want to I want to kind of because I've actually touched on this yet in previous in previous discussions, but so what what are the what are the existing issues for tracking for tracking? Carbon?

04:45
Yep, current state. Absolutely. So here it goes today. If you're unfamiliar, a bunch of people that a lot of math to figure out, generally speaking, the greenhouse gas emissions from a given thing, whether it's $1, or a pound of steel, cotton, whatever it is, they have guesstimate that they're called emission factors or conversion factors. And there's standard tables that you can access, multiply that by what's in your supply chain. And you are meant to get a directional idea of what's happening, your supply chain, great. That's today's sort of baseline best approach. The challenge with this approach is go to any supply chain professional, present this to them as their baseline. And then they're going to ask cool, how can I impact this number and reduce it. But if we're using internationally accepted, standard table, standard factors, you can't do anything really to change that. And so you're going to turn off supply chain folks our entire life is how do we unstick variable costs variable time variable anything to do more and have it cost us less, less time, whatever the case is. So this, I think, is a challenge to the fundamental fabric of a supply chain professional one, to a lot of supply chains are working really hard to transition their warehouses and factories and vehicles to renewable energy sources may be on site energy production through solar panels, reusable industrial packaging, they're trying to do all the right things. But these factors don't capture that. So how do we do something different? Of course, we can just try to track actual carbon through the supply chain super easy, right? Wrong. So it is estimated that about 15% of supply chains can see their tier two suppliers. That is my suppliers supplier, only 15% can see those. Then about 2% or less, it's a debated number of between two and 5% or less, fewer supply chains can see past here to put this in perspective. Cars typically are about 20 tiers, from car to planet. So any any supply chain, you've got think eight to 14 tiers is a pretty fair guesstimate for how many tiers you need to go. So this is a problem. Because if we're supposed to know the carbon flow, we at least need to understand the physical path that our materials are taking first. So first things first, we got to figure out actually what's in our network. That's really hard to figure in our supplier, supplier, supplier supplier, that by itself is really hard. Watching cannot help solve that problem. That is a different fundamental problem. We built our supply chains for cost and time. Sometimes for quality, we did not build them for transparency of partners. We love multi sourced supplier strategies because it gives us resilience, we say great, multiply that by every tier, we have in every supplier of every tier having multiple suppliers on multiple tiers. And we've got ourselves a massive network. That's a living, breathing organism that we don't know who it is. So that's one problem, then, let's imagine we try to then figure out the material flow through that network. It's going to vary sometimes by day, sometimes a month, maybe twice a year. But those supplier suppliers are going to shift and change based off of price and quality and availability and disaster recovery and something happened, there's a labor strike, all of a sudden, you have to go to your second third fourth choice supplier. So the flow of material through our networks is already very difficult to do. There have been lots of pilots doing this with Blockchain technology so that all of the paperwork and everything that goes along with it can be done diamonds, vanilla coffee, we've seen these, even the emissions from the leather in a Jaguar Land Rover car has been written to a blockchain to try to attempt to capture this. That's great, but that means they had to go all the way back and do all the work, find our suppliers, find the material flow. And then here comes the real Zinger, estimate the carbon impact or emissions impact at each and every stop along the way. So that means in the case of leather, not only the cow, but what was the cow fed? How was that wheat grown? What was the fertilizer source? How did it get to the cow? That's just the cow? Then we got to figure out where does it go? How is it treated? How was it processed with the entire supply chain to the car and out finally gets to you. Each of those activities has an emissions impact. We don't have a solid handle on how to do that. On the flight today.

09:33
If we can get those three pretty impossible elements sorted out. Yeah, let's

09:39
write it to the blockchain. Perfect. Let's do it. And then it can be handed off I don't mean to make light of it. Because we have regulations up ahead of us and ultimately will hand over log into a blockchain or some system to a regulator so that they can see audit what we've done, but we don't have to give away our secret sauce. It doesn't need to be publicly available to anyone. that is going to be a great solution. But we have a lot of upfront work to do first, before the system even matters. I'll pause.

10:11
That was amazing. Because there was a bunch of various things I hadn't even thought about you have a you have you have you have an excellent point where it is going to be almost impossible to track the carbon emissions of X. I'm thinking about I'm thinking about the Cal scenario. You're absolutely right. Jesus Christ. Yeah. The guy carbon emissions for the transportation guy Trent, the transportation for the cat to the to the to the slaughterhouse, the processing the heart to the manufacturing facility, how much did the manufacturing facility use? Totally crap, I didn't think about

10:47
that. Which grid? does it sit on? What's the energy source? How much did they use that leave a valve on that they keep the lights on high? I mean, there's so many variables to this. And there are technology solutions to start to break this down along the supply chain. They're nascent in some ways. In other ways, well, us building management solutions and light efficiency and all that kind of stuff is well in use. But we don't really look at it in this way to say, what's our running, and I'm gonna use the word ledger of carbon that we're putting into the hide in an embedded carbon type of a manner. And we do need a running ledger, we do need a running total, so that we can hand that off almost like a carbon price list, but it needs to be dynamic. And we hand that off then to our customer so that they can keep that along the way, those parts of a blockchain type technology. Absolutely, we're going to need it. But right now, I don't even know what it is we would write to the blockchain. There's just so many open questions up ahead of time.

11:49
Okay. So that's a good point.

11:55
Open questions. So in your opinion, one, what are the open questions that need to be answered? What are the research questions that need to be answered? Right? And to? If you're, if you're responsible for that, what would be like that implementation strategy? What would be the roadmap for this?

12:15
Really good questions. I think at this simplest level, we need to understand what is often called a carbon intuition. This is taught to me by the founder of a company called Jorah, which is a consumer facing emissions impact app, very cool app. But the same way that you look at a plate of broccoli and a plate of pizza. And you know, that one is much higher calorie count than the other. We don't have that intuition built for carbon today, we're not really sure if a turn on a light or turn on a blender, or drive my car. What's really the most carbon intensive we it's hard for us to get our heads around, we've just not been taught it. So I think fundamentally, the research question is what is the emissions impact of a given activity in supply chain? We are the stewards, The Guardian Angels have materials of inventory, but also a resources of the consumables, the lubricants, everything that goes into a factory, a warehouse, a vehicle, pallets, anything like that. That's not us. We're the ones who decide anything about it. We'd haven't really looked at carbon, but we can in a very similar way. So go back to my intro about seeing inventories. My favorite we're going to talk about that today. Because I predict we'll start to look at carbon very much like we look at inventory today. And instead of a problem, I think we'll start to look at carbon like a resource. And the big question is, is it going to sit on our balance sheet like working capital, like inventory? Like capital equipment, like an asset that we keep track of, or a liability because we're going to be taxed on it? And the answer is probably somewhere among all of those. But we're starting to see very interesting companies take carbon from someplace the most efficient way to do this is to capture it at the source, the point of emission. So whether it's industrial emissions, or there's a really cool company called Remora. That takes it out of the semi trucks. I'm shocked that not every truck has this already retrofitted on 80% captured out of the emissions wonderful. They take this carbon you get it from from the air, it's very inefficient, it's really expensive, but they're working on making that better. And then they're turning that carbon into materials like a really, really hard, really robust plastic. Imagine, because plastic after all is just carbon. It's fossil fuels. It's just carbon. And we can treat carbon like a building material, which I think is ultimately the way that we're going to do this like if you look around the room, wherever you are right now, unless it's glass or metal. It made out of carbon, we are carbon. That's what we are made out of. So I think ultimately, this will become a building material, but we haven't quite gotten the science to where it needs to be. So a very, very long winded way to answer your first question, but what is the emissions impact of a given activity? And I'm not sure there's anyone better placed than supply chain professionals to answer that question.

15:20
I forgot your second question, though.

15:25
So I was gonna say, you know, if you if you were to implement a strategy for this, what would be the implementation

15:33
that you wouldn't build up?

15:35
Absolutely. I think, you know, we most supply chains, most organizations now have a pretty good handle about what happens inside their four walls, I think we need to slightly expand our definition of our four walls and start to imagine when something is inside of our custody, what do we add on to that growing ledger? And so again, for folks in supply chain, if we think about somebody like our contract manufacturers, I would consider that inside of our custody, even though my greenhouse gas protocol standards, that scope three, I would still consider that within our realm of control, we'll call. So whenever a material comes into our control, we need to understand what we add to that carbon ledger and put that someplace, maybe it could be a blockchain solution, potentially, in the future. Today, I think there's a lot of ways that we can track information through existing controls our solutions, to say, here's what I added on. And we start to imagine, again, this idea of like a carbon or an emissions price list, it's ultimately going to take everyone doing that. And the expectation that along with an actual price list, you get an estimated carbon price list, this is just going to have to be how we get an idea of one supplier or another supplier. We can estimate it today, again, through factors but I think we can start to get pretty smart about estimating the material flow through a network. And then estimating the carbon impact of that as it goes, it's going to take some machine learning models. But I think it's possible with the technology we have today. So that we can start to get a good idea of what it is we're handing off to our customers. So this implementation guide, I think it has to come with this idea of a carbon intuition that's translated into an estimated carbon price list. And then perhaps there's some, when you deviate from that price list more, you know, plus or minus 5%, you need to disclose that to your customers, so that they know it. And again, ultimately, ultimately speaking, the solution will come from regulatory bodies, let's call it from the US government says anything that's happening in the US here is the solution. At that point, I think we will be ready for blockchain because it'll be a single system regulated. There very clear standards for what needs to be added at which point along the the process and secret decoder key only goes to regulators who needs to see it, it's not going to be accessible by very many people. So I think ultimately, that that's where we're gonna get. But to start with, I think this kind of taking care of what's in your control thinking about it in a way of like a chain of custody type of an idea.

18:26
So So you're saying it, so you said that we're gonna have like a secret decoder key for them and for this information, so you don't you don't think, you know, go in with a definition of blockchain? Because they we do have, you know, public and private changes. Right. But But ultimately, you don't think that this information is going to be transparent to to consumers?

18:48
I think, ultimately, it's good to disclose. Certainly, yes, I think it shouldn't be. I think it should be transparent, I don't think the entire supply chain should be transparent. Because we start getting into IP, I think it should look similar to a list of ingredients on the back of food or a more robust version of a made in China tag on clothes, it needs to be more robust than this. And we also need to be realistic that changing artwork on packaging is not a dynamic thing. So either we need to have estimates, or it needs to be printed, like like, batch numbers, expiration date, so then we need another little print that says actual emissions on this specific pack of Oreos or bottle of beer. This this is the actual emissions from this and I think we can get there. We'll buying decisions based off of it maybe, but I think, you know, kind of backup package front of package ideas front of package could be the brand promise of we'll never go over x, the missions, and that's the front of package bragging right and then you can flip it over or to say this specific lot? Or this how this package came through a process in a different way. Ultimately, I think we're leaving it there. And I think we can compete on it for some period of time, then I think supply chains will be shorter, and everybody gets better. But that's my Nirvana state that I live in, in my head.

20:17
Yeah, yeah, like that. Because whenever you're mentioning that I'm envisioning like a QR code. I'm envisioning a QR code, you can scan and then that kind of if it goes on the blockchain, then that's gonna be an NFT. Right? Always say that you've heard of NF T's. But you know, if it has a serial number, have a bat, if it has a serial number, it has a badge numbers gonna be NF T on the blockchain, right? So you can scan that QR code, a Red Cross represented NFT. And then it shows all that all those carbon emissions, actually like that. That was yours. You can trademark that one. So last question I have last question I have is, how long do you think is going to take? Because we're both on the same page that regulations come in, right? How long do you think is going to take or they're going to be stored on this and talking about it for a number of years are you think it's like right around the corner, in terms of in terms of publishing this information?

21:15
Who publishing a decade. regulatory pressure, it's here now. So if you look at again, I'll use the EU because they're a bit further ahead. They already have a battery focused digital product passport requirement that's already out, they have a carbon border adjustment mechanism to tax embedded carbon already out reporting sort of last month for both of those. But they give a three year runway for people to figure it out. So taxation starts 2026. So we're already in the kind of get ready mode, are reporting is meant to be starting now. But you won't really get dinged for it for a couple of years. So I think we'll give the b2b world a couple of years to get it figured out and feel confident about their data. And then it'll be exposed to the consumer. I don't think it's going to be earlier than five years. I'd be delighted if it was eight, but I think it'll be probably about a decade.

22:12
I'm trying to go through my notes, because there was one comment that I had in another interview, where it was kind of a dystopian view, where, you know, you're talking about you talked about b2b, you know, carbon carbon tracking and carbon tax. But there's been talks about being taxed on the individual basis, in terms of your carbon usage. Right. Now, do you think now again, do you think that? Do you think that

22:47
that's something that could be coming?

22:50
Or do you think that that's just talk because I begin, I think there's a little dystopian view of things?

22:55
I think, and this isn't my last question, because I gotta run. My, I don't believe I think we put a lot of pressure on consumers. I think they we are all functioning an economy that we did not choose to be in my plug for the circular economy really launched, like the linear economy today that we're in really launched Christmas Eve 1924, when a bunch of business owners decided to cap the light of a light bulb, and actually make it a worse product, so that they can make more money. That was the first known meeting where it was mentioned about Planned obsolescence. That's really the economy that we know today started that day, none of us chose to be in that economy. But here we are. Most of what we recycle gets thrown away. Anyway, most of our individual decisions, please, please don't ever want to get sad about this. But municipality wise, we are not going to make or break things, I think the big impact is going to be in b2b industry upstream. So that's the area that we need to fix individual carbon taxation, I think should have already been taxed upstream to whoever it is, who's producing the items, the choices they make, and the energy sources that they use to do whatever process they have. That's a place to tax, I do think if you have a choice for your home, to have a subsidized solar panel installed, in, in collaboration with your government, and that's a choice for you. Phenomenal, then definitely choose that as long as it's not going to ding the consumer, and they're going to have to spend more money on that. But in terms of pressure for consumers, or that we're all going to be taxed? I don't think that's fair to the individual consumer.

24:36
Excellent. I agree with that. So yeah, so Debra, thank you. Thank you for your time. Where can people were configurable people find you. Oh,

24:44
find me on LinkedIn. It's the best way I do actually right back. And you can also check me out at the circular supply chain Network website. We get together once a while we're a group of nerds who have conversations not dissimilar to this one on a regular basis and you're welcome to join us.

25:00
All right Deborah thank you thank you once again and everyone else until next time
