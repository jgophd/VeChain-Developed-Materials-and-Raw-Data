0:02
hey everyone and welcome back to the ve chain Foundation research on carbon
0:08
emissions and carbon credits uh today we have Taylor McCracken from coin Bureau
0:14
uh Taylor can you introduce yourself yeah thanks again for inviting me back on for another chats
0:20
um so as Justin just said I am uh work for the coin Bureau I'm one of the researchers and an analyst there I've
0:26
been there for a couple years um prior to the coin Bureau I've worked in blockchain investigation I was a
0:32
quality control analyst for a couple different crypto companies as well and I'm currently the editor of the the coin
0:38
bureau website so um but I understand the topic that we're going to talk about today is about you
0:44
know climate change um sorry if I just kind of jumped in front of you there and introduced the topic before you got to go into it
0:51
but uh I'll just say the one thing I am absolutely not though is a expert in
0:57
climate change so you know I'm I'm happy to kind of share my opinions of my views of it but uh I'll be the first to admit
1:03
that I am not the most educated on the subject I do spend a lot of time listening to people who are far more
1:09
intelligent than me discuss this topic and form some ideas and opinions that way so
1:14
um I do have some thoughts and questions to share but you know by no means do I consider myself an expert on this and by
1:20
no means do I even have necessarily an opinion one way or another um so I know this is quite a
1:25
controversial topic um but yeah so I so I'm just saying you know what I hear and what I feel
1:32
um but I'm always happy to be proven wrong and have my mind changed so yeah
1:37
all right so so let's let's let's get into it so I know one of the first
1:42
things that we want to that we want to delve into one of the things that we're researching is is the
1:49
whole idea of of organizations tracking carbon Emissions on the on the blockchain I
1:56
know that we briefly spoke about we spoke about you know Deborah Dole's interview right there was even
2:02
eye-opening to me you know and you know I talk a lot so actually I was a little bit spacious on some of the things that
2:07
she talked about so so what are your thoughts on on organizations tracking and carbon emissions then and having
2:13
their their things be or their information being transparent on a blockchain so I I think it's it's a good idea
2:22
um to be aware of our impact on the environment obviously without a doubt
2:27
um but one of the things that Deborah brought up and I think she really nailed it is um it's it's incredibly difficult
2:33
to do and and it's something that I think we're gonna waste more resources trying to do it than we'll actually be
2:39
able to um to successfully complete it so one of the issues right off the bat is there's no globally agreed standard on
2:48
you know these carbon credit like like they're um how they're how they're issued and how we're even tracking
2:53
carbon so uh I'm gonna kind of steal a bit from what Deborah was saying here but she brought up a really good point when she was saying um you know if we
3:01
want to track the carbon emissions from a supply chain from point A to point B there are a lot of things happening
3:07
between point A to point B right so say say we're hauling livestock and it's we have to know
3:12
what fertilizer did we use for that cow to eat um how far did we have to walk that cow
3:18
from point A to point B to get it on the truck um how many man hours were involved what about the factory that raises the cow do
3:25
they leave their lights on overnight um well kind of an energy Critter they're using and then when we get the actual
3:30
animal on the truck what kind of truck is it you know what's its engine um is it is it something that is fuel
3:36
efficient um so there are so many little checkpoints along the way and then that truck gets to the the destination and
3:42
say it goes into a slaughterhouse uh the slaughterhouse again like what kind of light bulbs are they using
3:47
um to you know are they these other kind of um these data points
3:53
to use and then we have to get that cow then to the grocery store then to the you know humans plates and uh so if you
4:00
kind of think about all those little checkpoints along the way if we're actually going to go and measure um the the carbon footprint for every
4:07
stop along that Journey I'm like that is an awful lot of resources and Manpower and I think we're going to end up using
4:13
a lot we're going to be using more resources and pro and possibly even contributing to a worse carbon footprint
4:21
just trying to track the journey from field to plates um so I do think that's quite an issue
4:29
um yes sir was that your question yeah yeah that was that was the question and that you have a good point in terms
4:36
of the tracking and Trace and how they're tracking and tracing maybe maybe an issue so so
4:41
that's just the effort in tracking and tracing it how are we going to get on the blockchain
4:48
how are we going to get every single one of those business partners to publish or write that information to you know the
4:55
blockchain and you know yes we yes we talked about how you know the iot iot
5:00
devices may be able to track that but that's just one piece of it you know that's just that's just logistical uh
5:06
portion of it now we're not talking about the you know the information that needs to be tracked by the farmers you
5:12
know what about the what about the methane the cows the cows relation to the atmosphere and things like that
5:17
exactly do when you start like measuring cow's farts and you know putting that in a scoring credit system as well so
5:24
um it's also and I I do think that blockchain has a really um
5:30
powerful potential for supply chain tracking you know like we were talking about how uh they used it during the
5:36
rollover the vaccines to try you know so I think blockchain can be really useful for you know tracking the journey from
5:43
point A to point B as far as you know it can relay data such as temperature and
5:49
location and how long it was stored at these certain checkpoints and I think things like that it's it's quite useful
5:54
to put those on a digital Ledger and use blockchain but as far as actually tracking the emissions that are that's
6:00
going on in the process I'm just not sure if we're quite there yet all right got it I appreciate that so
6:06
that's the that's that's step one right yeah yeah exactly that's step one
6:12
so so in another in another step you know what's your thoughts of what's your
6:18
thoughts of tracking you know carbon credits carbon credits from the blockchain
6:23
so uh carbon credits is another Hot Topic too right and um so I'm gonna pull from some notes here but um
6:31
I I think the carbon credit idea um for anybody who doesn't know it has been shown to be
6:37
um uh well just quite corrupt in its own nature so it was for the idea for them
6:44
was first kind of rolled out during the uh the Tokyo Court in 1995 and the UN did a study
6:50
um kind of like just read my own notes here um yeah the UN ended up doing a study
6:55
that just basically showed over 75 of the carbon credits issued
7:00
um there was no basically they were issued and nobody knows what even happened with them like you know they
7:06
just kind of went into the ether and they just um it disappeared so over 75 actually had no impact whatsoever and then what's
7:12
even worse than that is um they know that Russia and the Ukraine were basically using carbon credits for
7:17
watch trading um and there were actually like gamifying the system so one of the
7:23
things that um Russia was caught doing was um again with my notes I write like a
7:30
doctor um yeah so basically what Russia was doing is they were changing the um
7:36
basically the requirements so again this goes back to the fact that there's no agreeds
7:42
um issuance of doing this there's no like globally agreed way of doing it so basically what um Russia decided to do
7:49
is they were taking out the CFC and the hfcs which are greenhouse gases they were taking these checks out in 2011 and
7:55
then basically they were releasing carbon credits buying them back and then they were saying that they were taking
8:01
the CFCs and the hcfs um out of the environment and um basically what this was allowing to do
8:07
was it was allowing companies to increase their carbon outputs and because they weren't tracking the the
8:12
harmful portions of it right um so I probably I'm you know not really smart enough to even understand what all
8:17
that means um but yeah so basically they were just gamifying the system they were making millions and I want to give credit to a
8:25
there's a really brilliant uh YouTube video from Belinda Carr and she basically pulls up 10
8:33
um key instances that it's you know has been verified how the carbon credits
8:38
um system has has been quite corrupt and I think I'm not going to go through her whole video but I think one of one
8:45
of my favorite things that she really kind of puts into the ground is she brings up a use case of an oil tanker uh
8:51
it's a French company and basically what they're doing is they're pulling natural gas to the ground in Australia hauling it over to
8:58
China and you know that's using a hell of a lot of carbon and then what they did is they turned around and they
9:03
invested in a 10 year old uh wind farm in China and then all of a sudden they
9:09
were claiming that they were net like net carbon zero and she's like I'm sorry she's like having uh like wind power
9:14
does not directly translate to offsetting carbon she's like those are
9:20
two very different things they're like You released a lot of like carbon into the air and just by investing into a
9:27
wind farm that that's not negating the damage that was done um so one of my one of my biggest
9:32
personal issues with these carbon credits is we're basically allowing companies to pull more if they're
9:37
willing to buy these credits and we already know that the these credits are going towards tree farms where the trees
9:44
aren't even being planted in some cases there's been a you know a couple companies get in trouble for that they're claiming they're planting trees
9:49
that they're not and legally these trees can be cut down after 10 years so so say you're dumping loads of carbon into the
9:56
atmosphere um with the and you're buying these carbon credits or going to planting trees and also they can just cut these
10:01
tree down these trees down there for 10 years so um I kind of think this is similar to um
10:08
you know if you've got a bucket full of water and you're punching a bunch of holes in the bucket and you're patching the holes and it's like well wouldn't it
10:14
just been better if you didn't punch the the holes in the buck in the first place um you know if you truly cared about the
10:19
environment you shouldn't just be basically it's almost like a formal bribery it's a way of paying
10:25
um these companies extra money to to just let you pollute as much as you want um so I think the carbon credits are a
10:32
bit of uh it is a bit of a scam um something else actually Deborah has she
10:37
makes a really good point in in her note as well is again the lack of global standards so um Delta Airline pays two dollars and 30
10:44
cents per ton um for their carbon emissions Microsoft pays twenty dollars per ton and Bill or
10:51
sorry million and Bill Gates pays 600 million so it's like so why is Bill Gates having to pay far more than say
10:58
Delta um so like it if we're all polluting in the same way then why isn't there more of a standard across the boards so
11:04
there's just a lot of um yeah they're just too many inconsistencies for my liking
11:11
um and the fact that people are speculating on these as well it really kind of bothers me it's um
11:16
if our goal is to do what's better for the planet then why are we using carbon credits to speculative asset as well
11:22
we're using them to buy trade sell profit from like ultimately the these bloody things are
11:28
being used to yeah invest and buy sell thems own life so you're not really caring about the problem you're caring
11:34
about using these carbon credits as another speculative assets and furthermore is um this it kind of ties
11:41
into this ESG narrative as well and it's it's politics and corporations that are trying to dictate
11:49
the way that we're supposed to be healing the planet right and I'm like and the majorities are for-profit
11:55
companies and Enterprises that are trying to play by the this set of rules and for me personally I'm like if I sit
12:02
down in a room with 50 scientists who understands um the way the planet works and you know
12:08
they've studied the environment things like and if they tell me they're like you know this is what's best for the environment I'm I'm going to be inclined
12:14
to believe them but a bunch of you know been in business suits from companies and for-profit corporations trying to
12:21
tell me hey we can fix the planet while simultaneously padding their bank accounts
12:26
um that raises some red flags for me because they're not doing things if it's not in their best interest right and
12:31
that's money is always the bottom line um so I'm I'm skeptical of the entities
12:36
that are Behind These narratives as well and it's not just me sounding like a crazy person here I mean there's been a few states in the U.S who have openly uh
12:44
rallied against this you know ESG investment movement as well and uh the
12:49
governor of Florida is is you know he's actually proposing like anti-esg bills
12:54
and things like that um because yeah it's just been shown to be be a flawed model so I'm not saying
12:59
that nothing needs to be done about it but I don't think carbon credits are the way to go um maybe carbon offsets could
13:05
be could be an idea but again these are questions for people way smarter than me to kind of figure out
13:11
okay how they how do they say it how do they say it shots fired
13:18
oh just one humble man's opinion crazy rants on the internet yeah that's it
13:23
but so I actually so why you were yeah so I actually got I think I got that so exposing the carbon credit and offset
13:29
scam is that the one from Belinda car because there's two of us yeah so so um yeah Belinda Carr she puts it far
13:35
more eloquently than I do but yeah she just basically has one called um yeah carbon credit scam and even if you just
13:41
Google carbon credit scam um there's a lot of really good um and like and it's
13:46
not even just theories it's you know like the UN has found this through their investigations of things like that that
13:51
uh yeah the vast majority of these things aren't doing what they claim to do um
13:57
yeah it is a it's a bit of a shame and and I don't know if it was set up I mean I I would imagine it was set up with
14:03
good intentions but it's just you know like anything that's been gamified I mean it's and people will do with
14:08
everything right like I use uh I'm a big fan of this one crypto app where you basically get crypto for walking and
14:14
people hook it up to a drill and just spin a drill and they just get free and you know so it's like this app came out
14:20
with good intentions like let's get people fit let's get people moving and this guy's like no it was a sweatcoin
14:26
and this guy's like I'm just gonna hook it up to a drill and it's like so people are always going to find ways to mess with the system right
14:32
yeah I still I still get notifications from sweatcoin like three times a day about things you know so but you you
14:39
mentioned that so you mentioned that that there could be a potential solution for carbon offsets can you uh expand
14:45
expand on that one a little bit yeah I think so so again I'm far from an expert in this space but basically there
14:52
is a difference between carbon credits and carbon offsets and carbon credits is basically paying more so you can pull it
14:57
more in a sense and you can basically trade these things so if you have extra carbon credits left over sell them
15:03
whatever uh but what carbon offsets are is actually trying to have more of like a direct impact so you can capture
15:08
methane and you can use that for fuel um and just do things like lower energy
15:14
usage and invest in renewable energy and things like that so it's things that more have like a direct impact so
15:20
companies can actually say you know instead of using electricity we're now going to move to solar panel um and
15:25
there are there are benefits and um incentives in place to do things like that but uh I think some of the the most
15:33
impactful ones uh again we've seen with Bitcoin miners so you know they're taking flare gas that will just um
15:39
otherwise be wasting the atmosphere polluting as well and so instead of that just going the atmosphere Bitcoin miners
15:44
are now actually able to grab that and that would be a form of um carbon off setting because they're offsetting what
15:50
would be polluting and they're putting it to use to create Bitcoin um a lot of people do with things like methane is a big one for various
15:56
different uses um so I think um I I think what what's
16:02
might happen with carbon that I would quite like to see is is maybe not even try and reduce it maybe just find an
16:09
alternate use for it you know like so instead of just letting it go in the air and pollute let's let's caption let's do
16:14
something with it because I mean you know you and I are carbon plastic is carbon um so you know instead of just
16:19
wasting it let's let's maybe find a use for it I mean again these these are our questions and things for other people to
16:25
kind of figure out but um yeah so that it's kind of my two cents is is let's resolve the problem not just just throw
16:32
money at it right um and just go on another little bit of a tangent here is I I do think by us
16:39
trying to use blockchain technology you're getting too much enjoyment out of this um so I there's there's a an old cliche
16:47
that talks about putting the cars the the horse before the buggy right and I think blockchain has a tendency to that
16:53
as well so I'm obviously I'm a huge fan of blockchain technology I I think I can do some incredible things but I think
16:59
one of the things that V chain is trying to do is solve a problem that we don't even understand yet
17:04
um there there's no scientific consensus on what the problem actually is and you
17:11
know when we think about climate change so many people they just default so yeah the Earth's getting hotter but it's
17:16
actually a very complex multi-faceted problem it's um so you know they stop
17:21
calling it global warming and now it's climate change and it's like are we looking at this from a precipitation perspective are we talking about this
17:28
from a temperature perspective because in different parts of the world there's all sorts of different things going on you know there's flooding in one area in
17:34
droughts and out there like we've never seen before um you know we're breaking high temperatures low temperatures and and
17:40
there there's a lot more going on than just just Heating and and one thing that worries me about this is when the
17:46
scientific Community can't come up to uh with with the consensus I'm like how can
17:52
we understand what's going on or try and solve it when we don't even we can't even agree on what the problem is so
18:00
um I meant to grab the name of an interesting Ted talk but basically there was um a guy that was studying
18:06
um our impact on the environment I'll get the name too after this and basically he made a very revolutionary
18:13
Discovery and he actually found that one of the problems is just the fact that we are
18:18
um corralling livestock and keeping them in one area so he did an experiment in Africa where he was actually like let's
18:24
just let livestock just roam roam freely and that was his solution and and the effects were were quite
18:31
um incredible really so basically because the animals were walking and there were you know their feces and their urine
18:38
were spreading all over well it completely regenerated areas of the desert where they thought it's too air and nothing can grow as soon and so it's
18:45
you know a lot of scientists are like we need less cows less cattle less methane and this guy's all like well wait a
18:51
minute he's like I just put this in real profit or in real practice he's like I just put more cows more methane more
18:56
Livestock in the fields and it's actually regenerating the planet um and regenerating Greenery and stuff
19:02
so I think the the thing with with climate change is it's like we need a consensus we need to understand a
19:07
problem before we can tackle it um so whether or not crypto or blockchain is the solution I don't know
19:14
um but I I heard something that I I quite liked the other day and and I kind of related
19:20
to this issue here is uh they're talking about blockchain gaming and they're saying that one of the problems with
19:26
crypto is well on blockchain in general is we do have the potential to solve so many problems but maybe we're not the
19:34
right people to be doing it um so you're talking about like crypto gaming and the reason why crypto gaming is so cool crap
19:39
he's like because it's it's people in crypto trying to create video games it's the wrong way around he's like the video
19:45
game Community doesn't need crypto crypto needs the video game Community to adopt it and I kind of think about that
19:51
with what the teaching is trying to do as well it's first and foremost they're a technology company what do they know
19:56
about climate change I mean maybe they know a lot and I know that they do some work with the UN and I'm sure they've got some brilliant advisors on board but
20:03
I think crypto's focus should be on well blockchain sorry is they should just be
20:08
building the tools and you know the potential and then basically it's existing industry should
20:15
be integrating blockchain into what they do so ideally what I would like to see is again um I want to see this led this
20:23
initiative to save the world should be led from on academic and a scientific perspective it shouldn't be being ran
20:30
from the UN from politicians from business corporations it shouldn't be a blockchain company
20:36
um so you know I'd like to see it if if the scientific Community realizes they're like hey we can use
20:42
blockchain technology to help with our gold and great but I do find it a bit weird that it's vechain being like hey
20:48
let's save the planet it's like well wait you guys are a crypto company like let's yeah so I I think it might be be a
20:54
bit skewed so yeah I just need to understand the problem I think first and foremost interesting interesting
21:03
you brought up you brought up a you brought up a good a good point
21:08
and it made me think of another thing in terms of so you said that the the cow the cow Ted
21:15
Talk and I want I want to get that one by the way yeah I'll send it to you that one sounds great but so you said it was
21:21
regenerating regenerating you know the areas you know the Arid areas so what's your thoughts on what's your thoughts on
21:27
on this whole refile movement we're starting to hear we're starting to hear about within the web 3 space and my
21:34
second question my follow-up question is going to be based on your response
21:43
the intentions I guess and I and now I'm just going to completely contradict myself um because I I like to see it I do
21:50
um I kind of give a pretty corny answer but when people ask me what my favorite
21:56
blockchain project is um I often say whatever whatever one's trying to have the best impact on the
22:02
planet um so so I mean I'll get behind any blockchain project that seems like they
22:07
can make life better they can make you know the world better um which I you know I realize that
22:12
that's kind of contradicting what I've just previously said about why are crypto companies trying to do everything
22:18
um but I mean I I think it's a good first step and so yeah if a crypto company thinks maybe
22:24
they can take a crack at something and they can make the world a better place then I mean go for it I mean you've got
22:30
you know I'll stand by on the sidelines and I'll cheer you on with the flag and you know I hope they come with something
22:35
groundbreaking something revolutionary but I don't see it coming from the crypto Community I think I I think it's
22:40
got to come from the traditional and I think it has to be traditional industry who are experts in that industry and
22:47
that Niche and they're gonna have to adopt crypto into their world I don't see how it could be the other way around
22:53
um so you know the saving the planet thing I mean are you a blockchain developer or are you an ecologist I mean
22:58
if you're both awesome brilliant um and if you can work together then yeah great but it's not um crypto Bros
23:06
can't save the world you know it's uh we we need some some traditional experts in
23:11
these fields for sure yeah I love it I love it as you
23:17
can tell but all right so base So based on that answer
23:22
what do you think the implementation strategy would be
23:28
in order to successfully Implement a solution that would save the
23:36
planet with these protocols I know you I know you briefly touched on it but you know what's your thoughts
23:44
yeah so I think that's a tricky one so I think um the the traditional pillars are already
23:50
in place there's already people working on on these you know Solutions and and trying to
23:55
you know to greenify the planet and and make it a better place so I I guess I kind of see it if I have to kind of
24:01
picture in my mind it's it's basically it's like the tech is running along this Railway and then you know if we're
24:07
talking about you know to make things simple let's talk about bringing down global temperatures so there are people working
24:13
on that along this this you know linear path and then there are people working on the tech on on this side of the path
24:19
and at some point they're gonna have to merge um but I think
24:24
yeah I mean how they're going to integrate it I mean like I said I guess they're gonna have to build the tools the tech guys are going to have to build
24:30
the tools and then the people in in the real world Industries are going to have to see if they can adopt these tools to
24:36
help with their mission I guess what it's going to come down to yeah yeah and but the thing is like I
24:43
said like you say it's already there but I think the I think the bottleneck
24:49
is the education piece yes I might be biased but I think it's the education piece where you know the scientists and
24:56
the real people that understand the problems they don't understand you know blockchain you know so I think that and
25:03
I don't really think about I didn't really realize this until you actually explained it so I think that I mean we always talk about we always talk about
25:09
oh we need to educate the onboard we need to educate to to get the wild adoption but whenever we say educate
25:15
we're talking about educating people on setting up wallets and things like that you know you make an excellent point in
25:21
that we need to educate the scientists we need to educate the academics on what
25:27
the on what the potential is for these certain
25:33
blockchains because like you said they see blockchainers creating basically blockchain is ethereum and Bitcoin no
25:39
there's hundreds of there's hundreds of other blockchain level layer ones layer twos two you know blockchains out there
25:45
that are there for certain use cases you know you know you got you got the B
25:51
change you got the fellows you got the you know you got the algorithms that's that's looking to make a positive impact
25:56
on the planet you know uh hedera hadera hashgraph who are who are looking to you know focused on on the sustainability
26:02
aspect you know but even us within the web 3 space we can't keep up with them all you know so so so
26:10
I mean I think that you know the education from the technology is going to be is going to be a step that I don't
26:16
think that many people were actually looking at I mean there's too much going yes there's a lot going on not too much there's a lot going on in this space but
26:23
you know I think that you know education needs to be needs to need to be a closer look needs to be taken at that if we're
26:28
going to achieve what we're trying to achieve in a study like this or in a study like the
26:35
other interview you did with financial literacy no absolutely and again I think the topic with um yeah the environment
26:43
is I think again there has to be consensus among you know the scientific Community we have to understand you
26:48
can't solve the problem if you don't know what the problem is so it's you know first thing I do think we have to understand what the problem is and then
26:54
the best way to go forward with fixing it um but you know you might find this a bit interesting this is something that
27:00
really kind of blew me away with how um education and Academia is kind of uh
27:05
intertwining with blockchain is I got to attend this absolutely brilliant conference um it was held in Germany I was I I
27:11
dialed in remotely I know you know if I think like in environmental stuff is over my head This was um from the
27:18
medical community so it was professors from different German universities uh what she said it was universities all
27:24
over the world um but they were actually using and and stuff like this will amaze me because I cover a lot of like video game
27:30
crypto projects and like things that are fairly like low I mean highly entertaining love them but fairly low
27:35
impact and what this conference was all about is how um geneticists are using the ethereum
27:41
blockchain and I'm probably going to completely butcher this because this was all pretty high level stuff and I'm sitting there trying to take notes
27:48
um you know like a kindergartner scribbling with a crayon um but basically they were uh using
27:54
blockchain technology in a way to Globe to globally collaborate on the study of
27:59
genetic deformities in people and the reason why and you know one of the things is people are always like why does that have to be on the blockchain
28:05
just use a database um but they were using like ZK Roll-Ups and things in a way that um basically what this allowed to do because there's
28:11
always doctor client uh confidentiality so you can't just share things globally
28:16
so basically they were studying genetic deformities and collaborating on it globally and and because they were using
28:23
ethereum blockchain technology they were or something but basically it allowed all these different
28:30
um members of the scientific Community to look at the same case study without exposing confidential information about
28:35
the patients and you know look at the history and there are actually quite a few different use cases and that was the
28:41
first the first real eye-opener for me and that was about a year ago and that was the first real eye opener for me I was like man it's crypto is about more
28:48
than just Finance I mean blockchain has got a lot more than just finance and uh you know monkey pictures it's uh it's
28:53
making a fundamental impact on you know the medical community and hopefully we'll see the the greenhouse gas issue
29:00
so yeah hopefully it'll uh solve all sorts of problems yeah yeah and that's one thing that's one thing I keep
29:06
talking about from a supply chain perspective where organizations don't want to show everything you know across
29:12
their supply chain networks you know and and I think that zero knowledge proofs are going to have a massive impact once
29:19
organizations begin to to adopt to adopt a solution so so that's that's all that's all the
29:26
questions that I had I know we went this one went a little long and I loved every minute
29:31
so Taylor do you have any you want you have anything else you want to share no I mean I'll uh
29:37
get that in forward to you and yeah we'll keep in touch I'm really interested in the work you're doing and stuff so I'm definitely gonna you know
29:43
give you a follow and buggy every couple weeks see what you're up to absolutely so we're working everyone found you yeah
29:50
so obviously at the coin Bureau uh you can find me there uh I'm not very active on LinkedIn I am on there but I'm pretty
29:55
active on Twitter uh just at Taylor TBM and that's Taylor with an E so if you want to I drop some ridiculous memes and
30:03
hopefully some interesting crypto tidbits of information all right thank you thank you once again
30:10
for coming on and everyone else until next time yeah thanks for having me
30:15
thanks

VeChain Foundation Climate Research with Justin Goldston and Linda Dunn of Georgetown University

Video Link: https://youtu.be/r7Fa19FVdPk

hi everyone and welcome back
0:05
in this in this episode this is this is
0:07
going to be one of my favorite ones uh
0:10
this is one of my this is one of my
0:12
favorite leaders within the higher
0:14
education space or in the industry space
0:16
this is Linda Dunn Billy done Linda can
0:19
you introduce yourself
0:20
sure thank you Justin thanks for having
0:23
me here today so
0:25
um as Justin said I'm Linda Dunn and I'm
0:27
the faculty director for the supply
0:29
chain management master's program at
0:31
Georgetown University and school of
0:33
continuing studies
0:36
thanks thanks for that so
0:39
so at Georgetown do you all do any do I
0:43
do anything in the area of of
0:46
sustainability and you know Carbon
0:49
emissions and carbon tracking or what
0:52
have you what have you seen in that in
0:54
that particular area yeah there's first
0:57
of all just supply chain there's
0:58
tremendous interest in this area right
1:00
and I would say that the program at
1:03
Georgetown
1:04
um and you know this um from some
1:06
background uh right is uh very focused
1:10
on um Corporate social responsibility so
1:13
both from an environmental uh impacts
1:17
and also social impacts you know how how
1:20
does the supply chain play a role and
1:23
how can we improve
1:25
um both the environment and the social
1:27
impacts using supply chain thinking
1:30
about supply chain
1:32
um so really that that is a major focus
1:34
and I'd say the university overall has
1:36
done a lot of things and published it
1:38
you know with green energy
1:41
just to focus on sustainability overall
1:44
and that's really a part of you know
1:47
taking care of others in the world sort
1:49
of the Jesuit values that they have
1:53
excellent so
1:56
so I know all right so for disclosure
1:59
um I teach within the program at George
2:02
at Georgetown as well
2:04
um so so here's that's that's one of the
2:06
reasons why why you know some of the
2:07
questions will come up that's going to
2:10
come up later on but
2:12
I know that you you have you have some
2:15
some background in in blockchain and I
2:18
know that we talk about how to integrate
2:20
uh blockchain within the industry namely
2:22
within the supply chain space
2:25
um so
2:26
how do you how do you see
2:30
us leveraging this technology to make an
2:35
impact from a carbon tracking
2:37
perspective
2:39
sure Justin I think you know
2:41
anything that really needs to be proven
2:46
so to speak is going to be a place where
2:50
blockchain may play a role and so right
2:53
now
2:54
um there's a lot of claims in
2:56
sustainability
2:57
um I'll even diverse just from uh carbon
3:01
for a minute but you know just
3:02
sustainability practices we talk about
3:05
green washing what's real what's not
3:08
um as many companies are so focused on
3:12
you know zero carbon their pledges and
3:15
you know what can they do and how do
3:17
they measure you know really scope three
3:19
which is the hard part which is the one
3:22
where supply chain is involved right
3:24
they're going to need to prove it and
3:27
they're going to need to do it in a way
3:28
that they don't have to keep doing the
3:31
same auditing so to speak that's the
3:34
biggest issue right now is both the
3:36
measurement
3:37
but then also the certification and
3:40
that's where I think blockchain will
3:42
play a role with the certification
3:45
um you know it is hard to measure uh
3:47
there's a lot you know people don't have
3:50
necessarily all the same definitions
3:52
when they even talk zero carbon
3:55
um what about embedded carbon you know
3:57
in the construction industry and once
4:00
it's already there and so you once the
4:03
measurement and the definitions start to
4:05
form at least you know
4:08
stage one of it because I think it will
4:11
continually be refined
4:13
someone has to be able to certify that
4:16
so there's a lot of groups out there now
4:19
similar to when um
4:22
sarbanes Outlet came out and you really
4:26
with gap had to prove Beyond A
4:30
Reasonable Doubt right someone had to
4:31
sign off on it that the financials were
4:34
correct indeed and so with all that that
4:38
proving which is where I think we are
4:40
with carbon right now then there's the
4:43
audit statement right and for the most
4:47
part
4:48
um they're just doing an overall company
4:50
here's the audit for the company I think
4:53
when you start to get with carbon it's
4:55
going to be by product
4:57
and to do that you don't want to do it
4:59
again and again and again you want to
5:02
say I know the carbon footprint
5:05
um and it might be that we actually have
5:08
two pieces this is the piece
5:11
um you know basically uh before Freight
5:16
right here's the piece you know this is
5:18
what it is and then there's a second
5:20
piece that's associated with Freight
5:22
that might change for where the product
5:24
is going but the actual development and
5:28
manufacture of the product and all the
5:31
tier two tier three suppliers the
5:34
measurement of that is all put on a
5:35
blockchain it's certified you can prove
5:39
that with customer a b and c because
5:41
again you have thousands of customers
5:44
who want the same information
5:46
you can't you can't do each one
5:49
separately right and so I think because
5:51
it's going to be at a product basis
5:53
instead of just a company you're going
5:55
to need a way to have that audit have it
5:59
certified and be able to each time
6:01
present it and I say you may separate
6:04
Freight because obviously products can
6:06
be moved all around the world so there's
6:08
to me there it's almost like when you
6:10
have a price in supply chain right and
6:12
it's without the freight you know and
6:16
and then you add on the freight so I
6:18
think you might have the same thing
6:20
here's the carbon measurement here's the
6:23
blockchain that proves it and then there
6:26
might be another one that gets generated
6:27
with the freight
6:30
just some ideas
6:32
I love it I love it and
6:36
so I know that we're big we're big on
6:40
this you know we hope that this is the
6:42
utopian view you know of this space but
6:47
so given the given the kind of the the
6:52
rails of this of this study you know in
6:55
terms of desirability and feasibility
6:58
given that you spend a lot of time in
7:00
this space giving a lot of time to
7:01
aspirin that's a good time in the space
7:03
what do you think the desirability is
7:05
for a solution like this for those in
7:08
the industry I mean I know that's a
7:10
broad statement but you know think of
7:12
the trucking companies think of those
7:14
that that do that do act sustainably
7:16
think of those that are they're that
7:18
they're they're just primarily focused
7:20
on money right you know what's the well
7:22
in your opinion what's the desirability
7:24
or something like this
7:26
I think the desirability is going to
7:29
differ by industry a little bit and it's
7:32
going to differ by you know what your
7:35
role in the supply chain so I think
7:37
manufacturers first and foremost are
7:40
going to be the most interested
7:42
um just based on size based on margin uh
7:46
that they make
7:48
um you know those that have the ability
7:50
again that don't want to replicate yes
7:53
this product has this carbon footprint
7:57
right and and this has has this level I
8:01
think you're going to see it first in
8:02
the manufacturing base because it's
8:03
natural there uh after that when you
8:07
start to get to trucking companies Etc
8:10
that adoption would be afterwards from
8:13
my opinion only because the margins for
8:15
those type of companies tend to be
8:17
thinner right it's like technology where
8:19
does that get any technology it gets
8:22
adopted usually in industries that are
8:26
are have larger players and have better
8:29
margins that's that's you know because
8:32
they have the ability to put that in
8:34
without hurting their p l and as a
8:37
matter of fact as it becomes required I
8:39
think the manufacturers will again see
8:41
blockchain as a way to
8:45
um Implement something without having
8:46
the repetitive cost okay it's going to
8:49
cost me I have to get audited but it's
8:52
one time so that would be the savings
8:54
from their perspective
8:56
uh the industries like Trucking
8:59
um and again Maritime will come along
9:02
over time and again Maritime may be
9:05
faster
9:07
um but even you know they've made a lot
9:09
of money of recent but um there's been
9:12
times in the past where they haven't
9:14
made as much money either so
9:16
Transportation itself is just got um
9:19
smaller margins it's got more
9:21
independent players smaller players and
9:24
so again I think it'll start with the
9:26
manufacturing and then eventually as
9:29
costs come down
9:31
um it gets normalized the data is being
9:34
exchanged then it can move to the
9:37
transportation sector not that there
9:39
won't be any transportation companies
9:41
focused on blockchain and their carbon
9:44
footprint there will be I just we have
9:46
to recognize there's lots of
9:48
Independence there's lots of different
9:50
players and the margins are different
9:52
than some of the
9:53
um you know well-brained name known
9:57
companies so
10:01
okay excellent
10:03
so so based on So based on
10:08
based on what we discussed what do you
10:11
think the feasibility would be and if
10:14
you do think it's feasible how long do
10:17
you think that it would take for because
10:20
I know this you know it's going to be a
10:21
phased approach where it might be the
10:23
larger organizations you know adopting
10:26
it then you have a small and medium
10:27
organizations you know how long do you
10:30
think it would take if you think it's
10:32
feasible
10:35
um very good question I don't have the
10:38
crystal ball you know I I would assume
10:41
that
10:42
um you're looking
10:44
you know five years out for
10:46
manufacturers
10:48
um part of the issue when you look at
10:51
just the carbon measurement is the lack
10:54
of agreement on how to measure so that
10:58
is going to take another year to two
11:01
years just to get people on the same
11:03
page you know what does an audit look
11:05
like and maybe one to two years is is
11:08
actually optimistic
11:11
um no one likes you know the standard
11:13
better than their own standard right so
11:15
the idea of countries coming together
11:17
and of there being uniformity you know
11:21
how long will that take what I'm hoping
11:24
is we at least come to some basic
11:26
principles that would allow for
11:29
measurement with an understanding that
11:32
it would be refined like anything else
11:34
and it may have certain amount of
11:35
allocations to it that
11:38
isn't necessarily ideal but you know if
11:42
you're making uh you know if you have
11:45
any product
11:47
um the the core ingredient could be
11:50
going into multiple things so you know I
11:53
think before you're talking uh briefly
11:55
about a cow you're talking about a cow
11:57
but you know different pieces of that
12:00
cow are used different ways right sums
12:03
for me some is for the hide
12:06
um it could be you know different uses
12:08
and so all products have that too so
12:11
what's it being used for right and so
12:14
there has to be some amount it's like a
12:16
overhead cost you're going to have some
12:18
amount of allocations that have to
12:20
happen as part of this if there can be
12:22
agreement on how those get done what's
12:25
reasonable methodologies then you're
12:27
going to talk about the blockchain
12:29
really being able to come in and be that
12:32
verification piece so I'm thinking it's
12:35
three to five years
12:37
um and that may seem long but it takes a
12:40
long time for adoption and again it's
12:43
going to be the big companies and then
12:45
the smaller ones over time right and
12:49
um
12:50
you know I think with anything yeah
12:54
that cost you know this will the big
12:57
issue will also be how much does this
12:58
cost right so as costs go down
13:02
um then it becomes more and more
13:04
feasible and the timeline may move up
13:07
but that is always it has to have an Roi
13:09
people aren't going to do something
13:11
unless there is a return on the money
13:13
they're investing in it
13:15
yep I think yeah I think that's the big
13:18
I think that's the big
13:21
hang up in terms of in terms of you know
13:24
just primarily talking about the
13:25
blockchain you know the blockchain
13:27
technology you know you know artificial
13:30
intelligence that's going to say
13:31
organizations a lot of money but how
13:34
much is is a blockchain you know
13:36
solution going to say even organization
13:38
you know I think that some people see it
13:41
as a detriment because now I have to
13:42
show everything right
13:44
but you know we talk a lot about we talk
13:48
a lot about you know zero knowledge
13:49
proofs we talked about that at the at
13:51
the at the event that that you know uh
13:53
we did at Georgetown where you know we
13:56
can we can confirm that you're saying
13:59
that you're saying what you're saying is
14:00
indeed true without showing everything
14:02
you know and I think that if if supply
14:05
chain leaders are educated on that first
14:07
I think that we'll have I think we'll
14:10
have more
14:11
more acceptance I won't say Embrace
14:13
that's the little that's a little that's
14:15
a little quick I think that you know
14:16
they'll they'll have more acceptance to
14:18
actually listen to it more but you know
14:21
I know that
14:22
I know that we talk about about
14:23
blockchain and a sustainability class
14:25
you know in terms of I think we have a
14:27
case study in terms of B chain
14:29
um this study is actually uh for a v
14:31
chain but do you do you have other
14:33
classes where you talk about you know
14:35
artificial like Technologies such as
14:36
artificial intelligence and blockchain
14:38
within a program
14:39
oh absolutely
14:41
um sourcing class right strategic
14:44
sourcing and Contracting
14:46
um that's been a big topic both on you
14:49
know how will it I think from a student
14:52
perspective it's how will these
14:54
Technologies change my job how will they
14:56
change what I need to know
14:58
um so actually the last class we had
15:01
um we were talking about both of the
15:02
Technologies actually so
15:05
um you know and I think you make a good
15:07
point and with AI it's
15:11
um relatively cheap in many ways right
15:15
although uh we're still so I think
15:18
companies are going to see some savings
15:20
uh anything from reducing the workload
15:23
on code to you know being able to
15:27
replicate things we're just at the
15:29
Forefront of what will happen with AI
15:31
and they're already using it for
15:33
scouting as suppliers you know lots of
15:36
different ways that you can use that to
15:39
very easily bring back a large amount of
15:41
information sort through it but it's
15:44
still at this point requires you know
15:46
intervention by humans at some point
15:50
when you look at the blockchain I I
15:53
think that
15:55
um
15:56
contracts of sizable amount are
16:00
important but I think what you were
16:02
talking about you kind of hit the nail
16:03
on the head with the zero knowledge
16:06
proof right
16:07
um
16:09
the issue is Supply chains we talk about
16:12
this everyone wants to know the tier two
16:15
tier three but you're you're
16:18
manufacturers
16:20
um don't necessarily want you to know
16:22
that or if you're a distributor let me
16:24
use it that way because maybe you can go
16:26
around Supply chains weren't necessarily
16:29
built to be fully transparent both from
16:33
the risk of costs getting out there to
16:36
what are the actual ingredients I'm
16:38
using something's proprietary I you know
16:40
I've developed a formula I don't want
16:42
anyone to know that formula and I don't
16:45
want them to know my suppliers so we
16:47
have both when you're looking at
16:49
corporate social responsibility whether
16:51
it's carbon whether it's making sure
16:53
there's not forced labor no matter what
16:56
it is the difficulty lies in the fact
17:00
that
17:01
Supply chains don't necessarily want you
17:04
to know all their suppliers so if you
17:07
can do something where some pieces
17:10
hidden meaning the name of the supplier
17:14
amounts maybe not as much price
17:17
certainly right but if you can hide
17:22
those things but have the other pieces
17:24
verified without it being oh well I can
17:28
still figure it out without the name
17:29
right I mean there's there needs to be a
17:32
way
17:33
um and so I think that that can be done
17:35
and that would help sort of Grease the
17:37
wheels if
17:39
um you know if it didn't have full
17:41
transparency
17:43
and it may be you know using permission
17:46
blockchains at some point too where you
17:49
get permission to see certain things
17:51
right so it's that that combo that might
17:55
happen I see that in the medical area as
17:57
being something
17:59
um you know there's lots of different
18:00
use cases we're talking supply chain and
18:03
carbon right now but there's obviously
18:05
lots of different use cases and
18:08
um even for the for the carbon and
18:11
tracking it maybe it is permissions
18:13
maybe it's not just open and maybe you
18:15
only get to see it for you know certain
18:18
products you know same thing you have to
18:22
de-risk it for the people who are
18:24
putting the information out there and to
18:27
help de-risk it it may mean that some
18:30
things have to be anonymous
18:32
um so I know that goes against the
18:34
transparency piece but really you're
18:36
being transparent about a lot the part
18:38
that matters more than the part that
18:40
doesn't
18:42
um although people who want to use it to
18:44
see that the tier 2 or tier three
18:46
suppliers are financially sound they do
18:49
want to know the names but maybe for
18:50
carbon it doesn't matter all right so
18:53
that's where you might have even
18:55
different pieces of information that can
18:58
be attributed to the same company
19:04
yeah and I think he brought he brought
19:07
up about four good points there
19:09
um so
19:10
yeah because like whenever you talk I
19:12
mean and that's the whole thing about
19:14
about you know different blockchain
19:15
protocols and that they're going to have
19:17
their own their benefits you know their
19:20
their benefits and things like that so
19:22
you know with with v chain you know
19:24
Beach chain was focused on the supply
19:25
chain industry right and you know and
19:28
they're they're doing a lot within the
19:29
within the carbon tracking space now you
19:32
do mention you did mention the whole the
19:34
whole permission blockchain you know
19:36
permission blockchain thing which is
19:37
going to be a topic of discussion once
19:39
we actually get leaders in this space
19:40
but then there's another there's another
19:42
protocol that that has a number of use
19:44
cases called Casper so the Casper
19:46
protocol so they're actually you know
19:50
they're saying that you know one of the
19:51
main industries they're going they're
19:53
trying to address is a supply chain
19:54
industry but they they're called they're
19:56
they're referred to as a hybrid
19:58
blockchain where you can pick and choose
20:00
what information you want to be you know
20:02
transparent and then what what
20:03
information you don't but like I said
20:05
you know zero knowledge proofs will
20:07
actually give you that you know based on
20:09
certain use cases but natively Casper is
20:11
saying that you know we're we're a
20:13
hybrid blockchain so you know
20:16
uh
20:17
people as as organizations you know come
20:20
on to these protocols then we'll
20:22
actually kind of hash out these these
20:24
particular these particular things so
20:26
you know again that's going to be on
20:27
Down the Line
20:29
so all right last question probably
20:32
won't be but I'll say last question
20:35
what what challenges what challenges do
20:39
you foresee
20:40
um us having in you know tracking
20:43
tracking you know carbon carbon
20:45
emissions carbon credits Carbon offsets
20:47
on you know on blockchain in your
20:50
opinion
20:52
um because I've mentioned just first the
20:56
measurability right and and uh
20:59
methodologies
21:01
that's the biggest challenge in my mind
21:04
and then it's probably secondly is
21:08
getting who's going to audit and how are
21:10
you validating the auditors
21:13
so they may need their own credentials
21:16
that lie on the blockchain too to be
21:20
able to say yes I've done X Y and Z I
21:23
have this methodology of this level of
21:25
training away again that someone can't
21:28
rubber stamp so there's going to be some
21:31
you know it's going to be a cottage
21:33
industry in a way of just measurement
21:36
but then you have to know how how do you
21:38
validate the people who are measuring
21:40
this that they're using the same
21:42
methodology that they're trained so I
21:45
think that could be one of the uses for
21:47
the blockchain on sustainability as well
21:50
um and is that a challenge more that
21:54
you'll start like anything else with too
21:57
many and something has to shake it out
21:59
so there needs to be some kind of
22:02
I don't want to say governing body but
22:05
at least
22:06
um a group that is agreeing upon the
22:08
standards right the standards that would
22:11
be implemented for the measurement of
22:14
the carbon and who can you know who's
22:16
trained in it who's certified in it and
22:19
then
22:20
um The Challenge I think with it
22:22
actually going on the blockchain is
22:23
probably a little bit less uh other than
22:27
as we talked about you know being able
22:30
to possibly make some of it Anonymous I
22:33
mean I don't see the actual technology
22:35
piece once you have the measurement as
22:37
being that much of a roadblock I think
22:40
it's just getting people on the same
22:41
page for the measurement and then
22:43
getting that group even if you have that
22:46
who can now do the certifications they
22:49
would maybe be the issuers or utilize
22:52
the blockchain you know to issues that
22:55
have the ability to do that and
22:58
basically say yes I've put this on the
23:01
blockchain because they've certified and
23:03
this product has this much carbon
23:08
excellent thank you for that so yeah
23:11
that's all that's all the questions
23:12
that's all the questions that that I
23:14
have so Linda thanks thanks once again
23:18
um
23:19
where can people find you where can
23:20
people learn more about more about your
23:22
program
23:23

VeChain Foundation Climate Research with Fran Benedito and Chief Cherry of ClimateTrade

Video Link:  https://youtu.be/NYO_yk9-8EY

hi everyone Dr Justin Goldson here today
0:06
we have the team at climate trade
0:09
um chief chief has Chief me and chief go
0:11
way back we go back to the tedx the 10x
0:14
stage days back in Florida so Chief can
0:16
you kick us off and introduce everyone
0:18
including yourself
0:20
yes absolutely uh my name's Shannon
0:23
Sherry uh a lot of my friends and

colleagues call me Chief or chief Terry
0:28
uh Justin's so great to see you once
0:32
again uh we've got we've got a great
0:35
history together through tedx and uh
0:37
through being presenters and that
0:40
organization and uh I I thoroughly
0:43
enjoyed your uh your topic uh on
0:46
blockchain technology in tedx Cocoa
0:49
Beach a few years ago so I really
0:51
appreciate you inviting us on this call
0:53
I'm actually the director of sales
0:57
um with an emphasis on Aviation
1:00
at climate trade here in the U.S so I'm
1:03
working with uh Partners Partnerships
1:06
and uh just really working on clients in
1:10
Airlines Aviation airports you know that
1:14
industry and of course everyone else as
1:17
well that's just my focus but today what
1:20
I really wanted to bring is really the
1:23
CEO and one of the founders of climate
1:25
trade just an amazing person he's got a
1:28
great story and just really uh one of
1:32
the biggest reasons why I came on board
1:34
why I'm here today and uh just doing
1:37
awesome things in this space right with
1:40
with with climate uh with carbon offsets
1:44
with blockchain technology without you
1:47
know further Ado I want to introduce to
1:49
Fran
1:51
thank you so much
1:53
yeah thank you so much and thanks Justin
1:55
for for hosting us for having us here is
1:58
a pleasure and uh is mutual channel it's
2:02
like working together and you have a
2:05
strong background and we are very proud
2:06
to have you in the organization so
2:08
thanks for having us Justin and to have
2:11
him trying to trade today
2:13
yeah yeah thanks for thanks for coming
2:16
um so Fran can you can you just get us
2:18
started and and just talk about what you
2:21
all are doing uh within the within the
2:23
comment space and how you're actually
2:25
integrating that within you know or
2:27
leveraging blockchain to integrate that
2:29
yeah sure well basically climate trade
2:33
is a a marketplace where uh since it's
2:37
an Inception we try to create the
2:40
leading Marketplace in terms of Supply
2:43
user experience and bringing to the
2:46
company's smes not only corporations but
2:49
also smes but at the end also citizens
2:53
individuals that want to do something
2:56
against climate change the possibility
2:57
of accessing in a very clear transparent
3:01
way some of the biggest projects
3:03
worldwide and some of the biggest supply
3:06
of protection today we are the
3:07
marketplace with more projects in terms
3:10
of cardboard markets but not also not
3:13
only carbon credits but also
3:15
biodiversity Plastics energy other
3:17
things that are solutions for climate
3:21
change that need funding as well right
3:23
so we we thought when we started with
3:27
the project and there is a long story
3:29
behind that I don't know it doesn't come
3:33
to now to the the moment that um we
3:36
started with thinking okay if the
3:38
Natural Markets like the capital markets
3:41
not all capital markets and climate
3:43
markets are based basically uh OTC are
3:46
80 90
3:48
OTC today may they are worked by Brokers
3:51
how can we provide some transparency
3:54
traditionally out of this and we thought
3:55
on using blockchain technology but it
3:57
was a clear use case on providing real
4:00
data of the transactions to the end user
4:03
the people that was buying because today
4:05
you can go to get a
4:08
slide and offset and your carbon of the
4:11
flight but you don't really know if your
4:13
money is going to the developer of the
4:15
parade they are saying they are bringing
4:17
your money to or and you don't have full
4:19
transparency of how much is the cut of
4:21
the guy that is buying the providing you
4:24
the offsets or for real if the offices
4:26
are for real or not they can say they
4:28
are for real but you don't know if they
4:29
are canceled or not in the registry are
4:31
there so climate trade uses that
4:33
blockchain technology was like the first
4:35
um company to do it in the world in 2018
4:37
we were awarded by the UN by this and
4:41
basically we've been evolving through
4:44
our API to keep
4:47
constantly innovating in terms of
4:49
connecting our Marketplace to Registries
4:51
bring transaction in kilos not only in
4:54
terms which is what normally something
4:56
that and blockchain for us as a climate
4:59
trade it is a source of transparency
5:01
treasury before the end user right is a
5:04
tool to provide that
5:09
interesting so can you can you um
5:13
can you expand on this on this API
5:15
integration a little bit I know some of
5:17
it's proprietary but you know can you
5:19
can you give share some information that
5:21
you can share about government
5:23
application because it's public so it's
5:25
public so I mean anyone that wants to
5:27
enter climate trade can go to
5:29
market.climatree.com it is is full is
5:32
fully open to to the to any any user
5:37
um and basically our API
5:40
it was something that I I came up with
5:42
the idea I was getting a flight to the
5:45
cop in Bonn I think was 2018 and I was
5:48
making a speech there and I got a
5:51
Ryanair flight I pay five euros for my
5:55
carbon footprint of setting
5:57
and basically I didn't receive any
5:59
certificate any email I didn't know
6:01
where my money was going at all and I
6:04
thought okay why five euros which is my
6:06
carbon footprint where my money is going
6:08
and I said we have to make that totally
6:10
the opposite we have to provide food
6:12
transparency because we are also in the
6:14
age of transparency right so bring full
6:17
transparency to the end user and that's
6:19
what we brought so we certified in
6:21
blockchain every transaction that's how
6:23
the API was accepted was created so
6:27
today we have more than 35 Integrations
6:29
more use cases than anywhere worldwide
6:32
and I can put you examples of what we do
6:34
with the API we calculate an offset
6:37
and user transactions so whenever you go
6:40
to buy a product or service in some of
6:42
the companies we work with uh we
6:45
calculate the of the carbon footprint of
6:47
the product you are buying
6:48
then you buy it you can offset the
6:50
product and then you receive a
6:51
certificate that accreditates where your
6:54
money is going which product you are
6:55
investing and all that no and put your
6:58
examples in Spain there is a company
6:59
called carify which is the Uber of you
7:02
can call like the Uber of Spain in Latin
7:04
America so every ride you make with them
7:07
they charge you a sustainability fee
7:09
that's climate trade so basically every
7:12
every uh right that you make with them
7:15
we calculate real time the CO2 of that
7:18
right we you pay a sustainability fee
7:21
and then we issue a certificate for you
7:23
I suggesting Goldstone for your ride
7:26
with the CO2 and how much money you paid
7:28
into which spray it is going last year
7:31
it was a it was like more than 300 000
7:34
transactions of certificates coming from
7:37
that and that's only for B2B now we are
7:39
doing it for every single transaction of
7:41
Califa we did same thing with Santander
7:44
Bank for credit cards so now with
7:46
MasterCard and Santander we made a
7:48
project where it is already live in
7:50
Spain now to Portugal then to to
7:52
Brazilian worldwide when you pay with
7:55
your credit card we calculate the
7:56
payments with your credit card and you
7:58
can answer them
7:59
you can offset them same thing with gas
8:02
stations when you refill your car same
8:04
thing for cargo shipping uh
8:06
Transportation any any other sector that
8:09
you may imagine that's why Shannon is
8:11
targeting the airline sector we provide
8:13
transparency through the API to all the
8:16
airline combines
8:19
interesting so so yeah you got some
8:23
that's got some interesting stuff going
8:25
on so what so
8:29
what type of response have you been
8:31
receiving from from
8:34
businesses from consumers and if if
8:38
possible you know what what type of
8:40
feedback have you been receiving from
8:41
policy makers you know on the solution
8:45
well okay going for different the
8:48
different users in B2B is being
8:52
some very strong work of evangelism
8:55
evangelizing from the beginning so we
8:57
started in 2018
8:59
but our first customers started in 2019
9:02
We Didn't Start in the best country like
9:05
Spain it was not the like the most
9:07
mature Mark France was more advanced in
9:09
sustainability nor the countries Germany
9:12
but we led the the way of Transport let
9:15
the transformation in Spain towards
9:17
sustainability companies that now they
9:20
change the narrative in the market like
9:22
companies understand better
9:23
sustainability they have some
9:24
regulations going on in Europe as you
9:26
know they are like reporting regulations
9:28
and all that so companies are open to do
9:31
this they have targets of becoming Net
9:33
Zero before 2050 so they have to offset
9:36
they have to buy these projects so what
9:38
we provide is a tool in order to yeah
9:41
offset but offset generating positive
9:43
impact which is what I I'm trying to
9:46
pursue right I don't want you to make
9:49
green washing of what you're doing I
9:51
mean I want you to generate impact on
9:54
what you're demoing the money you're
9:55
spending so companies are very receptive
9:58
and now we want to do the same we did in
10:01
Spain and and in the other countries we
10:03
are present and we just acquired we just
10:05
enter in a new market in Germany
10:07
Switzerland in Austria in the dark
10:10
region and and we reincorporate we are
10:12
just Corporation now so we are uh like
10:15
growing and building our air force in
10:17
the country
10:18
and so that's not the perspective of b2e
10:21
b2c as you were saying before it needs
10:24
to be a little bit more educated on why
10:28
to buy offset because there is a lot of
10:30
uh misunderstandings there is a lot of
10:33
not ignorance but not too much knowledge
10:36
on on why they are options needed I mean
10:38
and I always put the same example if we
10:41
as us three we go and we reforest we
10:43
make a refresh station we have to put
10:46
out money right at work if we go to the
10:48
bank the bank is gonna say
10:50
how are you going to pay me back are you
10:52
going to sell the boot of the trees how
10:54
are you gonna pay me back and that's why
10:55
the carbon markets are so good because
10:57
that's a collateral that you can use to
10:59
fund your project
11:01
and then you receive money for doing
11:03
good for the plan that's that's the
11:05
beauty of the carbon markets that's why
11:07
they should be useful
11:09
if you do it properly because there are
11:12
people that obviously like in any Market
11:14
in any business they do bribery
11:17
we saw in the TV in the news people
11:20
conservating areas that didn't need to
11:22
be conservated there was a hunting area
11:24
of a friend they were just saying I'm
11:26
not going to make a little bit of money
11:28
here because I have these trees the data
11:29
are not under any threat and they just
11:32
started to to generate crazy all that so
11:34
that's why new tools new blockchain is
11:38
important for this because provides
11:39
transparency and new tools are coming to
11:42
say hey this bridge this generates
11:45
carbon press but it's generous carbon
11:46
crates because so because it's a
11:49
generous impact and that's why the end
11:50
user needs to be educated I agree and I
11:53
think that the mindset of all of us has
11:55
changed a little bit more after covet so
11:58
people
11:59
I don't think there are too many I mean
12:02
the percentage of deniers of climate
12:04
change are being reduced are coming down
12:06
every time more because I think that
12:10
we all know that something is wrong
12:12
right and and and at least what we want
12:16
is a let's do something about it right
12:18
every time more and if I can't round up
12:20
my purchase when I buy something and I
12:23
put that money towards the climate
12:24
that's not too pain too much pain for me
12:26
and I'm doing I'm doing a good thing for
12:29
the planet and institutionally as the
12:31
the third party you were asking in terms
12:34
of
12:35
um the institutional and the
12:36
requirements and all that we've been
12:38
having a lot we have a lot of good
12:41
acceptance by governments uh especially
12:44
in Latin America where we closed an
12:46
agreement with 35 countries to generate
12:49
regenerative agriculture projects so we
12:51
are working with an organization called
12:53
Ika which is a simply for agriculture so
12:56
we will be issuing carbon credits for
12:58
regenerative agriculture for rice for
13:00
coffee and for cocoa in the coming years
13:03
and we are doing projects also too
13:06
because we don't want to be only like
13:08
the the trader or like the marketplace
13:10
where three we want a pulse projects
13:13
that need funding at the origin and
13:15
because maybe they don't have the money
13:17
to generate the carbon prices to be sold
13:19
later they need the funding initially so
13:21
climate trade you can impose and you can
13:23
invest in projects that are in the
13:25
initial stages as well
13:28
very interesting
13:30
so
13:32
so do you think so you know it's my
13:34
fault it's my fault that you know if we
13:37
educate the consumers of the importance
13:40
of this you know they're going to
13:42
provide additional pressure for these
13:45
organizations to use to use Solutions
13:48
such as carbon trade but climate trade
13:50
because
13:52
the consumers aren't going to be
13:55
the users of a lot of these a lot of
13:59
these Solutions like carbon offices and
14:01
things like that it's going to be the
14:02
organizations but the consumers are
14:05
going to be the drivers to force
14:08
organizations to do it right yeah so
14:11
what's your what's your thoughts on that
14:13
look I think that there are companies
14:15
that are doing great on uh play applying
14:18
like their solutions to the to the end
14:21
users and I put your exam the other day
14:23
I was we work with three companies that
14:26
provide plastic
14:28
taken out of the ocean
14:30
and they call it plastic brands but they
14:33
don't they just don't sell the plastic
14:36
credits they use that plastic
14:39
making products so they are making
14:43
furniture they are making like like
14:45
tables they are making like benches they
14:47
are making chairs they are making
14:49
different things with that plastic
14:51
coming out of the ocean you buy the car
14:52
you buy the plastic credit but then the
14:55
company is using it to produce products
14:57
so which is great right so there's a
15:00
whole circle of economy so we we want to
15:03
try to do something similar with the
15:04
cardboard craze that here right so
15:07
imagine uh
15:09
at this point there are different
15:11
initiatives and and I put you for
15:13
example the other day we were talking
15:15
about uh I was around you know so I want
15:20
to normally use I was using Nike issues
15:23
and I went the other day and said well
15:24
lately they are not that comfortable I
15:26
need to maybe change and I went to the
15:28
store and I saw that Adidas were all
15:31
made with plastic out of the ocean and
15:34
they were really looking very nice super
15:36
comfortable and at the same time was
15:38
plastic of the ocean oh my change brand
15:41
like that so Nike now has two or other
15:45
brands are gonna say okay I need to
15:49
follow this trend so we are changing uh
15:52
with our like consumers changing the the
15:54
way the the market works and the
15:57
decision because they are consumers they
15:59
are not consumers they are pro-shumers
16:01
now they decide they they they make the
16:04
companies to to to make decisions based
16:08
on that right so I think it's really
16:11
relevant that that we put all connected
16:14
like that circular economy in in our and
16:17
and that something is happening
16:20
you just you just you just create a
16:22
journal article title for me prosumerist
16:24
I like that
16:25
that one that one's pretty awesome that
16:28
one's pretty awesome so
16:30
so you know
16:32
what So based on what you've seen based
16:35
on what you've seen what do you think
16:36
will be some of the some of the
16:38
drawbacks and challenges for the
16:40
tracking and tracing of you know Carbon
16:42
let me let me back up let me back up and
16:44
back up so going back to going back to
16:45
what you said about about the issues and
16:47
how we can use carbon
16:49
um Deborah Dole in the previous
16:51
interview said that you know some
16:53
organizations are in the early stages of
16:55
capturing Carbon on trucks and create
16:58
those you know Carbon blocks it's
17:00
expensive now but they're just trying to
17:01
just gauge it out to like trade carbon
17:04
blocks and they're gonna take that
17:05
carbon that trap carbon and then start
17:07
to build Builders with it right yes it
17:09
might be three or four years for that
17:11
but um we're in the early stages now to
17:13
track all that carbon from all these
17:14
trucks and and do that so that's just
17:16
one thing you know as compared to the
17:18
shoes
17:19
um
17:20
go ahead oh but no go ahead go ahead and
17:24
respond because I have a question after
17:25
that
17:28
we are working with a company coming
17:31
from the MIT friend of mine who is an
17:33
MIT under 35. he created a carbon
17:37
capturing solution with microalgae his
17:39
patented so he modified genetically the
17:42
the algae so it captures CO2 nitrogen
17:45
and suspended particles suspended
17:48
particles are more important even or
17:50
imagine a methane you know small
17:53
contaminant that CO2 suspended particles
17:55
are some of the causes of the biggest
17:57
health problems in the cities right
17:59
because and this is what you breathe so
18:02
these trees capture CO2 like 365 natural
18:06
trees you put them in the in the streets
18:08
in the places that you cannot put the
18:09
trees and then you get the the tubes out
18:13
of microalgae there is a reactor that
18:16
makes brings the Earth through that that
18:19
the algae makes the process of
18:21
photosynthesis it grows and every three
18:24
months you take off the tubes you take
18:25
the algae and you may compost for the
18:28
plants
18:28
so imagine I mean and there are
18:31
processes like in New York people don't
18:33
know New York City has a program that is
18:36
forcing every restaurant the rest of the
18:39
food has to go to a program that they
18:41
pick up every day and they may compost
18:43
for the plants for farmers
18:46
how much waste do we throw out of the
18:49
restaurants in Miami in Florida and
18:51
everywhere that goes to generate methane
18:53
emissions in a big scale
18:55
amazing you know so what I want why
18:58
don't we get that good practices and and
19:00
we get solutions that can uh be circular
19:04
economy for all of us you know and
19:07
that's something now so with the
19:08
allergies another another thing but
19:10
imagine hemp they are doing now with
19:12
hemp these are super carbon capturing
19:15
plant that we are working in a new
19:16
methodologies for that and you get the
19:19
the hair and you create hempcrete you
19:21
can build Camp Creek for the houses you
19:24
know so I mean there are whole a lot of
19:27
things like the the CO2 you were talking
19:29
about no I mean that's that's exactly
19:31
the type of things that we have to be
19:32
doing here
19:34
all right yeah thanks for that I have a
19:36
I have an hour and a half discussion on
19:38
on those types of things but
19:40
what are what I would say my last
19:43
question would be you know what are the
19:44
drawbacks and challenges to to tracking
19:47
to tracking carbon emissions carbon
19:49
offsets carbon credits on the blockchain
19:51
based on what you've seen given that
19:52
you've all you know began this process
19:54
begin this journey
19:57
okay that's that's a that's a that's a
20:00
good one and a complicated one but to to
20:03
go in deep but basically you know we
20:06
have a lot of iot devices that are
20:10
coming at different satellites drones
20:12
and
20:15
let's say tools to analyze the the the
20:19
soil and and different components so I
20:22
mean at the end we have the good part we
20:23
have a lot of electronics and a lot of
20:25
technology that we can connect to each
20:27
other we have digital mrvs we build the
20:29
first digital mrb worldwide and last
20:32
year uh well at the same time than
20:34
others are a good friend of us who's
20:36
doing a great job on digital mrv we
20:38
created one we connected to a registry
20:40
we included a certification combined the
20:42
middle and we created real-time
20:43
cardboard grades from solar it was a POC
20:46
because uh but we did it with solar plan
20:49
because you had a smart meter in there
20:51
like we created real-time carbon credits
20:53
we certified we registered and we put
20:55
themselves on climate trading what they
20:57
were sold in immediately and canceled in
20:59
the registry and issued the certificate
21:02
so there are uh the beauty of this is
21:06
everything was blockchain traced the
21:09
whole process since since generation
21:11
from the smart from the plan it was a
21:14
solar plant in a lake in Spain so we got
21:18
all the data from there we generated the
21:19
carbon print everything in real time and
21:22
it was sold in real time at the same
21:24
time so what I'm trying to say there are
21:26
a lot of tools that we can use the
21:28
challenges that you are that you're
21:29
mentioning is like how do you make that
21:33
reputable right because as you know
21:36
blockchain is great
21:38
but I mean the data that you put in
21:41
blockchain it has to be reliable it has
21:43
to be reputable right
21:45
because if you put a data that is not
21:47
reputable yeah it is public but it's not
21:51
good data so the the good source of data
21:54
for for for for for being in the
21:57
blockchain it is if it comes from a
22:00
device or something that is providing
22:03
good data at the end right so if you
22:06
have a smart metering in a solar plant
22:08
approved by the
22:10
state government County whatever it is
22:12
that is has that smart metering has a
22:16
all the technical approvals and
22:18
certifications of the market
22:20
why do I have to doubt of that data that
22:22
is marketing is providing then if I put
22:25
that data in blockchain that data is
22:27
correct I don't need someone to go to
22:29
test it because it was tested before
22:31
making the solar plant right so the data
22:34
is accurate that's the type of data it
22:37
so that's the type of challenges who is
22:39
what who is the one that is deciding
22:40
which data is good which data is not
22:42
right so it has to be the technology the
22:45
iot devices and all that that we are
22:47
using but it has to be some Frameworks
22:50
or at least some guidance some guides
22:53
from organizations that's why come up
22:57
different organizations like reporting
22:59
who tells how to report is it the
23:01
government no there is Task Force or why
23:04
TCF tftcd telling um task force for
23:08
a climate risk cluster that they say
23:12
okay or CDP carbon disclosure they have
23:16
to it has to be like this and the people
23:18
start to use the same way of reporting
23:22
you know the company at some point the
23:23
government will tell you it has to be
23:25
like this not like the European Union
23:26
for example you have to all the all the
23:28
regulation but yeah I mean we need that
23:31
because if not you and I we can go and
23:32
say okay I'm putting this data it is
23:35
accurate because I say so no I mean you
23:38
cannot be a judge in part right you have
23:41
to be one figure another right
23:43
yeah I know of you if I explain myself
23:46
yeah you did and like so that was one
23:49
that's one question that I've had for a
23:51
very long time how long do you think
23:53
it's gonna take well we do have one yes
23:56
we do have standards you know yes we do
23:59
have Frameworks but how long do you
24:01
think it's going to take until we have
24:02
one standard where all these standards
24:06
come together and say okay yeah this is
24:08
the one we're all going to go with
24:11
it won't be Wednesday in my opinion I
24:13
mean I I think that it will be a
24:17
well and a standard of process
24:20
with a minimums of course I mean that's
24:23
why the task force for voluntary markets
24:25
it was created so the ccps I mean they
24:28
are trying to bring up like a whole
24:31
uh let's say come on
24:34
process come on rules for everyone to
24:38
use so more and more standards are
24:40
coming before you were five there were
24:42
five now more coming to the ground and
24:45
more Technologies
24:47
generating carbon credits and they don't
24:49
have any standard they have just a
24:51
blockchain but it is certified by
24:54
someone but it is not a standard it is a
24:57
standard of process right how the guides
24:59
the guides on how to proceed with that
25:01
so I think that will be minimums to be
25:05
reputable and whenever you you follow
25:07
that and you are you have that minimums
25:10
of of what a carbon credit has to be
25:14
yeah I mean that can take I mean we are
25:18
already working on that there are a lot
25:19
of initiatives so
25:22
I wouldn't I wouldn't say a number of
25:24
years but I mean there are already
25:27
carbon increase being generated that
25:28
doesn't have any standard behind and it
25:31
just in blockchain right being generated
25:34
from The Source we did it last year and
25:36
there was not a standard behind it was a
25:38
certification company but it was all
25:40
electronically made right so yeah
25:44
excellent so yeah that was that's all
25:47
that's really all the questions that I
25:49
had
25:50
um do you have anything else that you
25:52
would want to add you want to let people
25:53
know about about the about about climate
25:55
trade
25:58
well I mean and that we are super
26:00
excited to to be now growing and and
26:04
accessing the the US market with all the
26:07
corporations here helping the to to
26:09
understand like
26:11
um that I mean not only this is about
26:14
like
26:15
offsetting is not something boring and
26:18
that they have to do because they have
26:19
to do it it's something that can
26:21
generate a positive impact that'd be
26:23
something very good for other
26:24
organizations in terms of supporting
26:27
projects and at the same time at the
26:30
same time the consumers are going to be
26:32
the ones that are going to be valuing a
26:34
lot that that the force that they are
26:36
doing now so we want to provide all our
26:38
expertise and our technology for the
26:41
companies to be able to do something
26:42
that matter for the planet
26:45
excellent excellent so thank you all
26:48
once again
26:49
um chief chief and friend where can
26:51

VeChain Foundation Climate Research - Justin Goldston w/ Mohamed Mnif Co-Founder of HERO

Video Link:  https://youtu.be/RPfYusUYDMw

hi everyone we're back with a with a V
0:05
chain the V chain research uh today we
0:07
have Muhammad Muhammad can you introduce
0:10
yourself to let everyone know what you
0:11
do within this space yeah actually uh
0:15
thank you for uh having me in the school
0:18
my name is
0:20
and uh I am an entrepreneur in the
0:24
climate space
0:25
uh having a financial and economic
0:29
background uh with uh with an experience
0:32
in
0:33
um the blockchain uh industry
0:36
entrepreneurship for the last six years
0:39
uh I started my my career as a chartered
0:43
accountant in the financial industry and
0:46
back in 2016 when I understood
0:50
that a more radical uh adjustment needs
0:55
to be done uh to vote to the financial
0:58
industry and I was having certain ideas
1:01
around circular economy and uh and like
1:05
the different new paradigans that were
1:09
introduced
1:11
um with a for the in this rural
1:15
resolution I would say and by that time
1:18
I had the chance to find my first white
1:23
paper and to take part of the the
1:27
ethereum conference in in Paris
1:31
and I fall in love with the
1:33
decentralized Technologies and in
1:36
general uh quit my job and went for an
1:39
entrepreneurship Journey around web
1:42
tweet uh built the first startup in
1:45
Paris uh allowing peer-to-peer energy
1:48
trading
1:50
and tokenizing carbon
1:55
credits at that time it's called latency
2:00
and we created the currency backed by
2:03
renewable energy back in 2020 I
2:08
co-founded a company in Tunisia called
2:11
the Darling blockchain House of
2:12
blockchain
2:14
which would she's positioned as the
2:18
blockchain have in North Africa and
2:22
since last year
2:25
I went uh with my two co-founders Silva
2:30
and Mauricio on a very exciting New
2:33
Journey around the project called hero
2:36
and it's a platform to connect citizens
2:39
around the world to climate mobilizers
2:42
working on policy change
2:46
to provide climate mobilizers a basic
2:50
income so they can go full time on what
2:53
we consider being the most important job
2:55
of our time
2:57
the Euro platform is built on web 2
3:01
today
3:02
using still using the blockchain
3:04
technology for uh for many traceability
3:09
and for voting on the platform uh but we
3:13
are still going on a web 2 model uh
3:17
currently
3:20
excellent thanks for that so so given
3:24
that you have given that you have
3:26
experience in working with individuals
3:28
in Paris and North Africa you know I'm
3:31
still I'm in the U.S you know I know
3:33
that there are some people in the US
3:35
that that are a little bit hesitant in
3:37
adopting you know these Technologies
3:39
because they feel that you know
3:40
blockchain is linked to crypto and
3:42
things like that right so so I guess my
3:45
first question is going to be what has
3:46
been the response from people within the
3:50
Paris region and the North Africa region
3:52
yeah actually this is uh something uh
3:56
that I came up to as well uh after a few
4:00
years after the upper experience in the
4:03
web 3 Industry and as much as they
4:06
believe it's a decentralization is uh
4:10
the future and I would say it's already
4:14
running today it's already happening
4:16
it's not even an illusion and it's a
4:19
deep belief uh that the the twin for wet
4:24
3 is already on the way
4:25
I still see some uh resistance in
4:30
adoption
4:31
uh from the mainstream unfortunately uh
4:35
due to lack of information due to
4:38
septicism uh and risk adversity and this
4:42
is one of the reasons uh we decided to
4:46
build Europe uh on a web 2 model today
4:51
very to validate the uh the value
4:55
proposition uh strengthen the community
4:58
around the real value prop and uh and
5:04
then uh adapt the model uh with the
5:08
market Trend toward the distance toward
5:11
full decentralization uh and using the
5:16
the web free architecture
5:22
okay sounds good sounds good so
5:27
based on based on the work that you're
5:29
doing based on the work that you're
5:31
doing
5:32
can
5:34
what are some of the what are some of
5:36
the things that people can do to
5:38
successfully Implement
5:40
um
5:41
uh sustainability efforts on the
5:44
blockchain
5:47
I think the main sentence is to
5:50
validate the solution and entrepreneur
5:54
is bringing
5:57
to a very specific pain
6:00
wherever it's being built on a
6:03
blockchain or not
6:06
the blockchain is a technology it's a
6:09
technology layer that can be used for to
6:13
secure the network to ensure to
6:18
traceability and transparency of the
6:20
system
6:22
but it shouldn't be on the top front
6:25
of what is being built
6:30
interesting interesting
6:32
so so can you can you kind of expand on
6:35
what what you've seen others have been
6:39
building have been building in
6:40
weathering and blockchain and
6:41
collaborations I know because I know
6:43
that you're that you work a little bit
6:44
with the silo Silo uh blockchain
6:48
a lot of projects that are being built
6:50
on uh on the seller Network and other
6:55
networks as well uh from mola to source
6:59
to stack the cello to to toucan uh
7:04
and it's between
7:07
defy refi uh mainly this is the the main
7:13
uh guideline that the cello blockchain
7:16
uh decided to to position itself in the
7:20
blockchain industry
7:22
and as much as a lot of this solutions
7:28
are today uh like functional and you can
7:32
already use them on uh if you have the
7:35
valora uh app uh as much as uh I believe
7:40
it's still scoped in in a small Niche
7:44
that can be uh enhanced and enlarged
7:48
with massive adoption token so
7:51
developers can add new layers of
7:55
pictures that can benefit the the user
8:00
excellent so so yeah thank you also one
8:04
you know what now one more question so
8:07
you mentioned you mentioned that you've
8:09
been you've been dealing with with
8:10
policy change uh and some in some areas
8:13
so what what have what has been the
8:17
response with the with the policy makers
8:19
and the regulators and also what's been
8:23
the what's been the process of educating
8:26
them you know within within this within
8:29
this process and these tools these
8:30
Technologies
8:32
um uh um personally what we are building
8:36
with hero around policy change is policy
8:39
change for the climate space not for the
8:42
blockchain or crypto regulation right
8:45
and and for both cases I think
8:48
uh an inclusive approach to Citizen in
8:53
order to
8:56
um it starts I would say with a
8:59
decentralized communication
9:01
decentralized glow and then comes the
9:05
decentralized finance but the basic
9:08
layer should be
9:09
a decentralized
9:12
conversation that needs to happen
9:15
between the different stakeholders
9:16
between citizen uh policy makers and
9:22
organization and different type of
9:24
organizations
9:25
before coming up to a decentralized law
9:29
that doesn't go top down but will work
9:32
more on a horizontal way and engage both
9:36
or multiple stakeholders and the
9:40
prediction of this decentralized law and
9:43
being implemented either in smart
9:45
contracts or different uh calendar of
9:48
agreements that can produce the
9:53
um the agreement I think the next Once
9:58
secured a decentralized agreement we can
10:01
go then to a decentralized finance
10:04
component and and and
10:07
creating value out of this agreement
10:11
excellent I appreciate that so thank you
10:14
for your time today
10:16
um Muhammad where can where can people
10:17
find you
10:19
actually uh you can find me on LinkedIn
10:22
it's my uh or Twitter both of them uh
10:26
still LinkedIn I think is my uh
10:28
most uh used social network
10:32
all right so once again thank you for
10:36
your time and everyone else until next
10:38
time thanks thank you very much have a
10:41
good time thanks

hi everyone and welcome back
0:03
to the B chain to be chain Foundation
0:05
research on carbon tracking and carbon
0:07
emissions
0:09
um today is it's a very special guest we
0:11
go we go way back uh Deborah doe Deborah
0:14
dog Deborah can you introduce yourself
0:17
absolutely thanks for having me on I I
0:20
love supply chain that's my most
0:22
favorite topic within their inventory is
0:24
is a near and dear to my heart topic and
0:26
I hear we get to talk about that a
0:28
little bit today
0:29
uh what I do during the day I work at a
0:32
company called genpact I'm their Global
0:34
Supply Chain sustainability lead and in
0:37
nights weekends afternoons I lead a
0:40
non-profit called the circular supply
0:41
chain Network
0:43
um also for fun pursuing my doctorate in
0:46
trying to figure out the relationship
0:47
between supply chain and the economy
0:49
eight years from now I should know the
0:51
answer so I'll report back then
0:55
yeah yeah we didn't talk about that one
0:57
offline but uh yeah so
Blockchain and Sustainability
1:02
so I know I know you know we've we've
1:04
had our we've had our conversations in
1:06
previous interviews about about you know
1:08
blockchain and sustainability and the
1:11
and the things that that come up in the
1:13
industry so can you kind of share your
1:16
thoughts in terms of you know if you
1:19
think that's
1:21
it was do you think that organizations
1:23
would adopt the tracking of carbon
1:26
Emissions on the blockchain and also do
1:28
you even think it's feasible
1:30
oh I would not advise them to do so and
1:36
I think it's feasible but I don't think
1:39
it's the best solution and I'll unpack
1:42
that a little bit
1:43
I know I'm your supply chain you're uh
1:45
your blockchain skeptic I think the
1:48
blockchain technology is a remarkable
1:50
thing for digital assets
1:52
it was originally invented to track
1:54
digital Assets in the form of currency
1:57
tokens when translated to the physical
1:59
world we have some misalignment of
2:03
problems that we're trying to solve I
2:06
think blockchain fundamentally helps to
2:08
resolve chain of custody understanding
2:11
what is the truth
2:13
um democratization of whatever it is
2:15
that we're trying to track fantastic
2:16
those are not normally the short list of
2:20
problems that Supply chains have in
2:22
trying to track some things through a
2:24
network so I don't think it's actually
2:26
the right tool to solve this problem and
2:29
we can unpack the problem
2:31
in a little bit but that's one challenge
2:33
I'm seeing the Second Challenge is that
2:36
we don't have an accepted it's not like
2:40
the blockchain just like there's no such
2:42
thing as the cloud there's a blockchain
2:47
just like a cloud exists out in the
2:50
world so we're starting to see
2:51
cross-chain providers to try to get
2:54
blockchains to talk to each other I'm
2:55
seeing hesitancy from one supply chain
2:57
oh I don't want to be on their
2:58
blockchain uh so until we get this
3:01
Market figured out I think ultimately
3:04
maybe a regulatory body from the US or
3:07
EU or a government will issue this is
3:09
the blockchain to use for track and
3:11
trace on this food or pharmaceutical or
3:14
something like this but for now there's
3:16
not a blockchain and so there's you do
3:19
all this work to do a pilot on one
3:21
blockchain type that turns out the same
3:23
problem we had with the control Towers
3:27
everybody's on a different version
3:29
so that part is hard the third challenge
3:32
which is being actively worked on I will
3:35
acknowledge is that blockchain tends to
3:38
be extremely energy heavy energy
3:42
intensive
3:43
and I have not done the math on this but
3:46
I could suppose that depending on what
3:48
you're tracking you're going to end up
3:50
expending more carbon for the energy
3:53
just to fuel the validation of your data
3:57
then the thing that you're actually
3:59
trying to track to begin with so you end
4:00
up sort of at a
4:02
negative result to your problems those
4:04
are the three big challenges we can
4:06
certainly unpack why carbon tracing is
4:09
already difficult but those are my
4:11
couple of challenges I would love to be
4:13
challenged on any of these I will change
4:15
my mind
4:17
no you know you know you know I'm a
4:19
blockchain maxi and you you put some
4:22
good points you know you know you did a
4:23
good job if you shut me up
4:29
so I I want I want to expand on that and
Existing Issues
4:33
I want to I want to kind of because I
4:35
haven't actually touched on this yet in
4:36
previous in previous discussions but so
4:39
what what are the what are the existing
4:42
issues for tracking for tracking
4:44
um carbon current state
4:47
absolutely so here it goes today uh if
4:51
you're unfamiliar
4:53
uh a bunch of people did a lot of math
4:55
to figure out generally speaking the
4:58
greenhouse gas emissions from a given
5:01
thing whether it's a dollar or a pound
5:05
of steel cotton whatever it is they have
5:08
guesstimate uh that they're called
5:10
emission factors or conversion factors
5:13
and there's standard tables that you can
5:15
access multiply that by what's in your
5:17
supply chain and you are meant to get a
5:19
directional idea of what's Happening
5:22
Here supply chain great that's today's
5:24
sort of Baseline best approach
5:27
the challenge with this approach is go
5:29
to any supply chain professional present
5:32
this to them as their Baseline and then
5:34
they're going to ask cool how can I
5:36
impact this number and reduce it
5:39
but if we're using internationally
5:41
accepted
5:42
standard table standard factors you
5:45
can't do anything really to change that
5:47
and so you're going to turn off supply
5:49
chain folks our entire life is how do we
5:51
unstick variable costs variable time
5:53
variable anything to do more and have it
5:56
cost us less less time whatever the case
5:58
is so this I think is a challenge to the
6:01
fundamental fabric of a supply chain
6:03
professional one
6:04
two a lot of Supply chains are working
6:07
really hard to transition their
6:09
warehouses and factories and vehicles to
6:11
renewable energy sources maybe on-site
6:14
energy production through solar panels
6:15
uh reusable Industrial Packaging they're
6:18
trying to do all the right things but
6:20
these factors don't capture that so how
6:23
do we do something different of course
6:25
we can just try to track actual carbon
6:28
through the supply chain super easy
6:29
right wrong so uh it is estimated that
6:34
about 15 of Supply chains can see their
6:37
tier 2 suppliers that is my suppliers
6:41
supplier only 15 can see those
6:44
uh then about two percent or less it's a
6:48
debated number between two and five
6:49
percent or less fewer Supply chains can
6:53
see past tier two
6:55
put this in perspective cars typically
6:58
are about 20 tiers from car to planet
7:02
so any any supply chain you've got think
7:05
8 to 14 tiers is a pretty fair guest of
7:09
it for how many tiers you need to go so
7:11
this is a problem because if we're
7:12
supposed to know the carbon flow we at
7:15
least need to understand the physical
7:16
path that our materials are taking first
7:19
so first things first we got to figure
7:21
out actually what's in our Network
7:23
that's really hard figuring out our
7:25
supplier supplier supplier supplier that
7:27
by itself is
7:29
really hard
7:31
blockchain cannot help solve that
7:33
problem that is a different fundamental
7:34
problem we built our supply chains for
7:36
cost and time sometimes for Quality we
7:39
did not build them for transparency of
7:41
Partners we love multi-source uh
7:44
supplier strategies because it gives us
7:46
resilience we say great multiply that by
7:48
every tier we have and every supplier of
7:50
every tier having multiple suppliers on
7:52
multiple tiers and we've got ourselves a
7:54
massive Network that's a living
7:56
breathing organism
7:58
that we don't know who it is
8:00
so that's one problem then let's imagine
8:03
we try to then figure out the material
8:06
flow through that Network it's going to
8:09
vary sometimes by day sometimes by month
8:11
maybe twice a year but those supplier
8:14
suppliers are going to shift and change
8:15
based off of price and quality and
8:17
availability and disaster recovery and
8:19
something happen there's a labor strike
8:20
all of a sudden you have to go to your
8:22
second third fourth choice supplier so
8:25
the flow of material through our
8:26
networks is already very difficult to do
8:30
there have been lots of Pilots doing
8:33
this with blockchain technology so that
8:35
all of the paperwork and everything that
8:37
goes along with it can be done diamonds
8:40
vanilla coffee we've seen these happen
8:43
even the admissions from the leather in
8:46
a Jaguar Land Rover car has been written
8:48
to a blockchain to try to attempt to
8:50
capture this
8:51
that's great but that means I had to go
8:53
all the way back and do all the work
8:54
find their suppliers find the material
8:57
flow
8:58
and then here comes the real Zinger
9:00
estimate the carbon impact or emissions
9:03
impact at each and every stop along the
9:06
way so that means in the case of leather
9:09
not only the cow but what was the cow
9:10
fed how was that wheat grown what was
9:14
the fertilizer Source how did it get to
9:15
that guy that's just the cow then we got
9:17
to figure out where does it go how is it
9:19
treated how is it processed what's the
9:21
entire supply chain to the car and out
9:23
finally gets to you each of those
9:25
activities has an emissions impact we
9:28
don't have a solid handle on how to do
9:31
that on the Fly today if we can get all
9:35
of those three pretty impossible
9:37
elements sorted out
9:43
and then it can be handed off I don't
9:44
mean to make light of it because we have
9:46
regulations ahead of us and ultimately
9:49
we'll hand over log into a blockchain or
9:51
some system to a regulator so that they
9:53
can see
9:54
audit what we've done but we don't have
9:55
to give away our secret sauce it doesn't
9:57
need to be publicly available to anyone
9:59
that is going to be a great solution but
10:02
we have a lot of upfront work to do
10:04
first before the system even matters
10:08
I'll pause
10:11
that was amazing because there was a
10:14
bunch of there's things I hadn't even
10:15
thought about you have a
10:17
you have you have you have an excellent
10:19
point where it is going to be almost
10:21
impossible to track the carbon emissions
10:23
of
10:25
because I'm thinking about I'm thinking
10:27
about the cow scenario you're absolutely
10:28
right Jesus Christ yeah
10:33
carbon emissions for the transportation
Carbon Emissions
10:35
you guys the the transportation for the
10:37
cow to the to the to the slaughterhouse
10:39
the the processing the the the high to
10:42
the manufacturing facility how much did
10:44
the manufacturing facility use holy crap
10:46
I didn't think about that one which grid
10:47
does it sit on what's the energy source
10:49
how much did they use to leave a valve
10:51
on did they keep the lights on High I
10:53
mean there's so many variables to this
10:55
and there are Technology Solutions to
10:57
start to break this down along the
10:58
supply chain they're nascent in some
11:01
ways in other ways well used building
11:03
Management Solutions and light
11:05
efficiency and all that kind of stuff is
11:07
well in use but we don't really look at
11:10
it in this way to say what's our running
11:13
and I'm going to use the word Ledger of
11:16
carbon that we're putting into that hide
11:18
in an embedded carbon type of a manner
11:21
and we do need a running Ledger we do
11:23
need a running total so that we can hand
11:25
that off almost like a carbon price list
11:28
but it needs to be dynamic and we hand
11:30
that off then to our customer so that
11:32
they can keep that along the way those
11:34
parts of a blockchain type technology
11:37
absolutely we're going to need it
11:40
but right now I don't even know what it
11:43
is we would write to the blockchain
11:45
there's just so many open questions up
11:48
ahead of time
11:49
okay
11:51
so that's a good point
11:54
the open questions
Research Questions
11:57
so in your opinion one what are the open
12:00
questions that need to be answered what
12:02
are the research questions that needs to
12:03
be answered right
12:04
and two
12:07
if you were if you were responsible for
12:08
that what would be like that
12:10
implementation strategy what would be
12:12
the road map for this
12:15
really good questions I think at the
12:18
simplest level we need to understand
12:21
um what is often called a carbon
12:25
intuition uh this is taught to me by the
12:27
founder of a company called joro which
12:29
is a consumer-facing emissions impact
12:32
app very cool app
12:33
but the same way that you look at a
12:35
plate of uh broccoli and a plate of
12:38
pizza and you know that one is much
12:42
higher calorie count than the other
12:44
uh we don't have that intuition built
12:47
for carbon today we're not really sure
12:50
if I turn on a light or turn on a
12:52
blender or drive my car
12:55
what's really the most carbon intensive
12:57
we it's hard for us to get our heads
12:59
around we've just not been taught it so
13:01
I think fundamentally the research
13:03
question is what is the emissions impact
13:05
of a given activity
13:07
in supply chain we are the stewards the
13:10
guardian angels the materials of
13:12
inventory but also of resources of the
13:15
consumables the lubricants everything
13:17
that goes into a factory a warehouse a
13:19
vehicle pallet anything like that that's
13:22
on us we're the ones who decide anything
13:24
about it
13:26
we haven't really looked at Carbon but
13:29
we can in a very similar way so go back
13:31
to my intro about seeing inventory is my
13:33
favorite we're going to talk about that
13:34
today because
13:36
I predict we'll start to look at Carbon
13:38
very much like we look at inventory
13:40
today in a set of a problem I think
13:43
we'll start to look at Carbon like a
13:44
resource
13:45
and the big question is is it going to
13:47
sit on our balance sheet like working
13:49
capital like inventory like Capital
13:53
Equipment like an asset that we keep
13:55
track of or a liability because we're
13:58
going to be taxed on it and the answer
14:00
is probably somewhere among all of those
14:02
but we're starting to see very
14:04
interesting companies take carbon from
14:08
some place the most efficient way to do
14:09
this is to capture it at the source uh
14:12
the point of emission so whether it's
14:14
industrial emissions or there's a really
14:15
cool company called Remora that takes it
14:18
out of the semi trucks I'm shocked that
14:21
not every truck has this already
14:22
retrofitted on 80 captured out of the
14:26
emissions wonderful they take this
14:28
carbon you can get it from from the air
14:31
it's very inefficient it's really
14:32
expensive but they're working on making
14:33
that better and then they're turning
14:36
that carbon into materials like a really
14:39
really hard really robust plastic
14:41
imagine because plastic after all is
14:43
just carbon it's fossil fuels it's just
14:45
carbon
14:46
uh and we can treat carbon like a
14:49
building material which I think is
14:51
ultimately the way that we're gonna do
14:53
this like if you look around the room
14:55
wherever you are right now unless it's
14:57
glass or metal
14:59
it's made out of carbon we are carbon
15:02
that's what we are made out of uh so I
15:04
think ultimately this will become a
15:06
building material but we haven't quite
15:07
gotten the science to where it needs to
15:09
be
15:10
so the very very long-winded way to
15:12
answer your first question but what is
15:14
the emissions impact of a given activity
15:16
and I'm not sure there's anyone better
15:18
placed than supply chain professionals
15:20
to answer that question
15:22
I forgot your second question though
Implementation Strategy
15:25
so I was going to say you know if you if
15:28
you were to implement a strategy for
15:30
this what would be the implementation
15:33
that you would build up absolutely I
15:36
think you know we
15:39
most Supply chains most organizations
15:41
now have a pretty good handle about what
15:43
happens inside their four walls I think
15:47
we need to
15:49
slightly expand our definition of our
15:51
four walls and start to imagine when
15:53
something is inside of our custody what
15:56
do we add on to that growing Ledger and
15:59
so again for folks in supply chain if we
16:01
think about somebody like our contract
16:03
manufacturers I would consider that
16:05
inside of our custody even though by
16:08
greenhouse gas protocol standards at
16:10
scope three I would still consider that
16:12
within our realm of control we'll call
16:16
so whenever a material comes into our
16:19
control
16:21
we need to understand what we add to
16:24
that carbon Ledger and put that
16:26
someplace maybe it could be a blockchain
16:28
solution potentially in the future today
16:31
I think there's a lot of ways that we
16:33
can track information through existing
16:35
control tower solutions to say here's
16:38
what I added on and we start to imagine
16:40
again this idea of like a carbon or an
16:42
emissions price list
16:45
it's ultimately going to take everyone
16:47
doing that and the expectation that
16:49
along with an actual price list you get
16:51
an estimated carbon price list this is
16:53
just going to have to be how we get an
16:56
idea of one supplier or another supplier
16:59
we can estimate it today again through
17:02
factors but I think we can start to get
17:04
pretty smart about estimating the
17:07
material flow through uh Network and
17:10
then estimating the carbon impact of
17:12
that as it goes it's going to take some
17:13
machine learning models but I think it's
17:16
possible with the technology we have
17:18
today so that we can start to get a good
17:20
idea of what it is we're handing off to
17:23
our customers so this implementation
17:25
guide I think has to come with this idea
17:28
of a carbon intuition that's translated
17:30
into an estimated carbon price list
17:34
and then perhaps there's some when you
17:36
deviate from that price list more you
17:38
know plus or minus five percent uh you
17:41
need to disclose that to your customers
17:43
uh so that they know it and again
17:45
ultimately ultimately speaking the
17:48
solution will come from regulatory
17:49
bodies let's call it from the US
17:51
government says anything that's
17:52
happening in the U.S here is the
17:54
solution at that point I think we will
17:56
be ready for blockchain because it'll be
17:58
a single system regulated
18:01
uh very clear standards for what needs
18:03
to be added at which point along the the
18:05
process and secret decoder key only goes
18:09
to Regulators who needs to see it it's
18:11
not going to be accessible by very many
18:14
people so I think ultimately that's
18:15
where we're going to get but to start
18:17
with I think this kind of taking care of
18:21
what's in your control thinking about it
18:23
in a way of like a chain of custody type
18:24
of an idea
18:26
so so you're saying it so you said that
Transparency
18:29
we're gonna have like a secret decoder
18:31
key for them and for this information so
18:32
you don't think you don't think you know
18:34
going with the definition of blockchain
18:36
because we do have you know a public and
18:39
private change right but but ultimately
18:41
you don't think that this information is
18:44
going to be transparent too
18:46
to Consumers
18:49
I think ultimately it's good to disclose
18:54
certainly yes I think it should be I
18:57
think it should be transparent I don't
18:59
think the entire supply chain should be
19:01
transparent because we start getting
19:02
into IP
19:04
I think it should look similar to a list
19:05
of ingredients on the back of food or a
19:08
more robust version of a made in China
19:10
tag on clothes it needs to be more
19:13
robust than this and we also need to be
19:16
realistic that changing artwork on
19:18
Packaging
19:19
is not a dynamic thing so either we need
19:22
to have estimates or it needs to be
19:25
printed like uh like batch numbers
19:28
expiration dates then we need another
19:30
little print that says actual Emissions
19:33
on this specific pack of Oreos or bottle
19:37
of beer this this is the actual
19:39
emissions from this and I think we can
19:41
get there uh
19:43
will buying decisions be based off of it
19:45
maybe but I think you know kind of back
19:48
of package front of package ideas front
19:50
of package could be the brand promise of
19:53
we'll never go over X emissions and at
19:57
the front of package bragging right and
19:59
then you can flip it over to say this
20:01
specific lot or this how this package
20:04
came through a process in a different
20:05
way ultimately I think we're gonna get
20:07
there and I think we can compete on it
20:09
for some period of time
20:10
and then I think Supply chains will be
20:12
shorter and everybody gets better but
20:14
that's my Nirvana state that I live in
20:15
in my head
20:17
yeah yeah I like that because whenever
20:18
you're mentioning that I'm I'm
20:20
envisioned in like a QR code I'm
20:22
envisioning a QR code you can scan and
20:24
then that kind of if this goes on the
20:25
blockchain then it's going to be an nft
20:27
all right I always say it I mean you've
20:29
heard of nfts but you know if it has a
20:31
serial number probably if it has a
20:33
serial number it has a batch number it's
20:34
gonna be nft on the blockchain right so
20:37
you can scan that QR code it cross
20:40
references that nft and then it shows
20:41
all that all those carbon emissions I
20:44
actually like that that was yours
20:46
trademark that one
20:48
yeah so
20:52
last question I have last question I
20:55
have is
20:56
how long do you think it's going to take
20:58
because we're both on the same page that
21:00
regulation is coming right
21:03
how long do you think it's gonna take or
21:05
they're going to be Steward on this and
21:07
talking about it for a number of years
21:08
or you think it's like right around the
21:09
corner in terms of in terms of
21:12
publishing this information
21:15
publishing a decade
21:19
uh regulatory pressure it's here now so
21:21
if we look at again I'll use the EU
21:23
because they're a bit further ahead they
21:25
already have a battery focused digital
21:28
product passport requirement that's
21:30
already out they have a carbon border
21:32
adjustment mechanism to attacks embedded
21:34
carbon already out reporting started
21:36
last month for both of those
21:37
but they give a three-year runway for
21:41
people to figure it out so taxation
21:43
starts 2026 so we're already in the kind
21:46
of get ready mode where reporting is
21:50
meant to be starting now
21:52
um but you won't really get dinged for
21:53
it for a couple of years
21:54
so I think we'll give the B2B World a
21:57
couple of years to get it figured out
21:59
and feel confident about their data and
22:02
then it'll be exposed to the consumer I
22:04
don't think it's going to be earlier
22:05
than five years I'd be delighted if it
22:07
was eight but I think it'll be probably
22:09
about a decade
22:12
I'm trying to go through my notes
Carbon Tax
22:14
because there was one comment that I had
22:16
in another interview
22:17
where it was kind of a dystopian View
22:21
where you know you're talking about you
22:23
talked about B2B you know carbon carbon
22:25
tracking and carbon tax but there's been
22:29
talks about
22:33
being taxed on an individual basis
22:35
in terms of your carbon usage all right
22:38
now do you think now again do you think
22:42
that
22:43
do you think that
22:47
something that could be coming
22:50
or do you think that that's just talk
22:52
because I again I think that's a little
22:54
dystopian view over things I think this
22:56
is my last question because I gotta run
22:58
my I don't believe I think we put a lot
23:03
of pressure on consumers I think they we
23:07
are all functioning an economy that we
23:08
did not choose to be in my plug for the
23:11
circular economy it really launched like
23:13
the linear economy today that we're in
23:15
really launched Christmas Eve 1924 when
23:17
a bunch of business owners decided to
23:19
cap the light of a light bulb and
23:21
actually make it a worse product so that
23:23
they could make more money
23:25
that was the first known meeting where
23:28
it was mentioned about planned
23:29
obsolescence that's really the economy
23:31
that we know today started that day none
23:32
of us chose to be in that economy but
23:34
here we are
23:35
most of what we recycle gets thrown away
23:37
anyway most of our individual decisions
23:40
please please don't everyone gets out
23:41
about this but municipality wise
23:44
we are not going to make or break things
23:46
I think the big impact is going to be in
23:48
B2B industry Upstream so that's the area
23:52
that we need to fix individual carbon
23:54
taxation I think
23:56
should have already been taxed Upstream
23:59
to whoever it is who's producing the
24:02
items the choices they make and the
24:04
energy sources that they use to do
24:05
whatever process they have that's a
24:07
place to tax I do think if you have a
24:09
choice for your home to have a
24:12
subsidized solar panel uh installed in
24:16
collaboration with your government and
24:18
that's a choice for you uh phenomenal
24:20
then definitely choose that as long as
24:22
it's not going to ding the consumer and
24:24
they're going to have to spend more
24:25
money on that uh but in terms of
24:28
pressure for consumers or that we're all
24:30
going to be taxed I don't think that's
24:32
uh fair to the individual consumer
24:36
excellent I agree with that so yeah so
24:39
Deborah thank you thank you for your
24:40
time um working people working people
24:42
find you oh find me on LinkedIn it's the
24:45
best way I do actually write back uh and

conversations not dissimilar to this one
24:56
on a regular basis and you are welcome

VeChain Foundation Climate Research - Justin Goldston Interviews Daniel Krupka of Coin Bureau

Video Link: https://youtu.be/GHhNak2dhjg

hi everyone and welcome back to another interview for the V chain Foundation
0:08
research um today we have Daniel with us Daniel can you introduce yourself and let
0:13
everybody know what you do yeah yeah so my name is Daniel I'm the head of research at the coin Bureau
0:19
we're the largest YouTube channel about cryptocurrency uh you can think of me as kind of being the back end to guys front end for simplicity's sake and uh yeah
0:27
and yeah that's it all right I like it short and sweet so
0:32
so um we we briefly talked about this interview
0:38
um talked about the work we're doing we're doing with v chain to to to understand among among industry leaders
0:45
as to the desirability and feasibility of tracking carbon credits carbon offsets carbon Emissions on the
0:53
blockchain as well as you know this whole this whole emerging topic of of refi so so can you you know begin to to
1:01
give give your thoughts on on any one of those topics or all of those topics
1:06
yeah yeah sounds good so I don't know uh I mean I imagine if the viewers are you
1:13
know if they know of each and chances are they know the coin Bureau but we did a video about carbon credits I think it was a couple months back uh and I did
1:20
the research for that one so I do actually have quite quite a bit to say there um I guess I'll start by saying that my biggest concern about
1:27
the carbon credits in general is basically well one is that there are no kind of like Global standards I think
1:33
that's something that's been raised many times as well um there is kind of like a global standard for what counts you know what what what
1:39
um I don't know like how many how many trees need to be planted for it to count as one you know as one uh kilogram CO2
1:44
or what have you uh that's been removed from from the atmosphere so one is is the absence of Standards uh the the
1:52
second issue is kind of uh well basically that a lot of these carbon credits I mean to I I I'm not going to
1:59
use any explicit language here but let's just say that they're they're just they're just scams basically you're selling it like again because there's no
2:05
because there are no standards because there's there seems to be there seems to be lacking regulation uh that you
2:11
basically have you know people that are saying you know yeah yeah of course like you know here you can um I don't know here's a carbon credit that I'm just
2:16
gonna sell to you because of this piece of land that I have and I'm gonna I'm Gonna Keep it nice and safe but you know they were never planning on building on it anyway uh and and you know they they
2:23
basically have all this money coming in and it's yeah and there was that article that I had sent you Justin from the
2:28
guardian recently something like 97 of of carbon credits issued by like the largest carbon credit issuer
2:35
um basically they actually don't reduce carbon now there's been lots of concerns that even the whole scheme of carbon credits uh basically uh like
2:42
incentivizes because it's like you you don't actually reduce any emissions you just you just pay you just ask people to
2:47
pay for it uh and and if that money is not used wisely then in the end all you're doing is just you're just
2:53
creating basically another speculative Market which you know to be honest is this is kind of what I what I think a
2:59
lot of these uh refi uh projects are kind of doing is they're they're trying to tap into the speculative aspect of of
3:04
um of you know the carbon credits Market where you know it's if you think about it at least again and I'm happy to be
3:10
corrected on this if either you Justin Noe or someone you know feel free to reach out or reach out to me on on LinkedIn or Twitter or what have you but
3:17
my understanding of carbon credit markets is that obviously the goal is to reduce carbon so that means that every single year uh the amount of carbon
3:23
credits that can be issued is reduced and if you just simply supply and demand Dynamics tells you that the price of
3:29
this carbon credits are going to go up over time uh so this is this is you know they're they're in lies the speculative
3:34
aspect you're basically it's it's literally like investing like another kind of like a like Bitcoin but the problem is that this Bitcoin that we're
3:41
talking about uh is not transparent at least again like I'm not talking about the blockchain part I'm talking about the actual issuance of carbon credits
3:47
the actual issuance of carbon credits is not transparent uh you can't really verify anything that's going on
3:54
um and the bigger issue is that if you if you do end up in a scenario and this is you know this touches on a bigger issue uh if you do end up having global
4:01
standards and and I know that I think the United Nations is working on like a global carbon credit system or something like this but if you end up with a
4:08
centralized Authority that takes control of the whole carbon credits then what you're investing in when you're buying you know like either when whether I mean
4:15
I'm not I don't want to name any names but from any of these real five projects when you buy these tokenized carbon credits uh you're basically you're
4:21
basically buying kind of like a stable coin that has properties that are similar to bitcoin if that makes any sense where the issue doing Authority
4:27
behind those carbon credits could at any time they could say that you know one of these refi projects for no reason we don't like what they're doing so we're
4:33
no longer going to issue carbon credits to them and all of a sudden the value of those tokens goes to nothing and then
4:39
this is again this is a an issue where when you get a headline saying that 97 of the carbon credits from this
4:44
particular issue are we're faulty and don't reduce carbon then what does that do to the price of the tokenized version of that asset right like would you see
4:51
it's the equivalent of someone said hey the reserves for you know one of the largest stable coins has been seized or
4:57
is not I imagine someone came and said 97 of the reserves for tether uh you
5:02
know which some would say is the case but I don't think it is but let's just say for sake of argument if 97 of the reserves were tether were actually
5:08
worthless then what would happen to the price of usdt obviously it would go down and that's you know that's obviously a Financial Risk there's a huge risk to
5:14
the protocols that are otherwise doing really good work um so that's that's kind of like I guess a couple thoughts there the other thing
5:20
that I'll throw out and then I'll let you jump in there just because you know I can keep going forever but um the
5:25
other thing that I'll mention and is that you know do when it comes to this issue and I guess and trading of carbon
5:31
credits is that something that you know specific people actually want to be transparent do people actually want to
5:37
know uh do these institutions actually want to know uh or do these institutions want you to be able to see how many
5:43
carbon credits they hold do they want you to see when they're moving carbon credits around um there's a case to be made that the
5:48
institutions don't want that and it's my personal belief that uh you know as much as privacy has been you know the the
5:54
kind of black sheep of the crypto industry ultimately it's going to be the institutions the central banks the governments you know when when's when
6:00
central banks start buying cryptocurrency in 2025 they're going to start calling for for some privacy protections because they don't want you
6:06
to be able to see how much Bitcoin a certain Central Bank holds and and I think that you already saw the I guess to go on a little bit of a tangent but
6:12
you're already kind of seeing this with the we already saw this with the Taproot upgrade which you know like Top Root whatever it sounds like it's nothing but
6:18
in in short what tapu did for Bitcoin is it made all the transactions appear the same whether it's a multi-sig whether
6:23
it's going and joining a lightning Network whether it's a atomic swap and all of a sudden you've created actually when you have a separate layer you can
6:30
now you know interact with different layers of Bitcoin with some degree of privacy and I imagine we're going to see something similar with the carbon
6:36
credits uh where they're probably going to end up migrating to some sort of Layer Two that's going to be specifically for uh refi uh and maybe
6:42
I'm making a big prediction now but but I but I think I think that you know similarly to nfts I think the biggest
6:48
opportunities in refi is going to be actually uh whatever base layer is powering these tokens and I do think
6:54
it's going to be a layer two of I mean it could be a layer one but I have a feeling it's going to be a layer two that's on something like ethereum because again institutions want security
7:00
more than anything else uh and and the most secure blockchains you know for for better for worse for the time being are
7:06
Bitcoin and ethereum uh so so this is kind of I guess we're anyway that I I could keep going on the tangent but I
7:12
hope you have some some interesting thoughts there no you you actually yeah I got about four I got about four bullets here but you bring up an
7:19
excellent point in terms of in terms of privacy in that you know I come I come
7:25
from a supply chain industry right and whenever I whenever I ask you know leaders of organizations you know about
7:31
blockchain you know that's their primary concern the Privacy we don't want to use
7:36
our our data our data is our competitive advantage and all these things like that so you make an excellent point you make
7:43
an excellent point when you talk about the whole privacy piece and that's one that's one thing that's one thing I talk
7:49
about a lot in that I think that zero knowledge proofs what's in once the
7:56
Enterprises come in I think zero knowledge proofs are going to be massive I think that your knowledge proofs are
8:04
going are going to that I think zero knowledge proofs are going to be the thing the solution the tool that kind of
8:11
gets in gets these organizations into the blockchain space right because once
8:17
they now once now it's going to take it's going to take someone like you all to kind of create the education so that
8:24
they understand it right once they get to that point then they'll
8:31
understand that that that zero knowledge proves may may provide you know the the Privacy that you know they're they're
8:38
concerned about which which turns a lot of these organizations away you know from from blockchain because they think
8:44
yes yes it's transparent right now going back to everything you said
8:52
if we include zero knowledge proofs do you think that do you think that
8:57
blockchain could be a viable solution to kind of to kind of
9:04
alleviate some of your concerns that you that you spoke about uh
9:11
I think I think so but again the my bigger concern I guess and I I probably should emphasize a little bit more is my
9:16
I mean I guess I didn't really much but my biggest concern in general with carbon credits is kind of you know again
9:22
the goal again is to reduce carbon which you could make the argument you know whether reducing carbon all the way down
9:27
to zero is something that you necessarily want to do in an economy that's you know that's that's the debate that can be had
9:33
um but not only that but what kind of INS What I'm really concerned about when it comes to whether it's tokenized or not
9:38
um what I'm concerned about is the incentive that the whole carbon credit scheme is going to create because again if you like right now at least to my
9:45
understanding and again feel free to correct me or anyone can correct me here but carbon credits are restricted I
9:51
think and Justin you had mentioned this I think before we started speaking that carbon credits are really right now more geared towards institutional use uh and
9:58
but this is something that is because I guess at least in Europe for example like institutions basically they have to
10:04
buy carbon credits to offset you know some X amounts and each year the European Union reduces the amount of
10:10
carbon credits that are available because of course they're trying to reduce the carbon emissions but the problem but so you know that's all well
10:16
and good but what happens when you start to apply this to let's say to people where you actually do introduce like an individual carbon credit score which is
10:23
kind of like the more dystopian element of what we had mentioned in our video where uh basically every year the
10:28
government or whoever would give you x amount of carbon credits that you can spend and then what happens to people who are you know less fortunate
10:35
um who are you know historically you could say like marginalized where they're basically forced to you know
10:41
basically to not consume any carbon whatsoever and basically in some cases probably literally almost kill themselves to to not use any carbon so
10:49
that they can sell it for money so that they continue to survive and each year that that amount gets smaller and smaller meanwhile the rich folks who
10:55
have the closest connections to the organizations that are going to be issuing these carbon credits whether it's the government whether it's the uh
11:00
the United Nations the individual it'll be the same thing that we have today with Fiat money where the people who
11:05
have the closest connections to the commercial Banks and the central banks they can borrow directly uh at a rate that no one can and then they buy up all
11:12
the assets and then they use those assets as collateral to borrow even more and if they default and the government bails them out and we're going to see
11:17
the exact same thing in my opinion if we go down this path we're going to see the exact same thing happen with carbon credits we're at the beginning it's I
11:23
think it's actually going to be really good but then over time you're going to see these really perverse incentives of all the same way they did in the
11:29
traditional Financial system and you're basically going to see all these institutions just getting richer and richer because they have the closest
11:35
connections to the issuance of these the issuers of these carbon credits I personally think that the the best thing that blockchain could do zero knowledge
11:42
proofs or not whether it's the biggest thing that refi could do is find some way of in a decentralized way issuing
11:49
decentralized carbon credits that do not require a centralized issuer so where you can actually have verifiable proof
11:55
that yes this this carbon was reduced uh you could potentially do this you know using peer-to-peer networks something
12:00
like helium where you can set up sensors and you can show proof of you know things like you know you can really get
12:05
some really interesting ideas but in my personal opinion there's two ways that refi can go either refi can decide that
12:11
they're basically going to be a stable coin issuer that of a stable an issue of an asset that you know is going to have
12:17
the same perverse incentives as a fiat currency and they'll get rich in the process but if they roll out Central Bank digital currencies then all the
12:23
money they make will be worthless anyway but that's the topic for another time um but but you know either they can go
12:28
that path or uh they can decide you know what we're going to do things differently instead of instead of
12:34
integrating with the existing system we're going to disrupt it we're going to make some sort of decentralized carbon credit that can be verified by anyone
12:40
that anyone can issue where I can basically prove and be like you know look this you know this month or this week I you know I I traveled less or I
12:47
consumed less and you could prove that to the blockchain and the blockchain will reward you with a carbon credit and you don't have to go to some centralized
12:54
issuer and you won't have the same perverse Dynamics come up um that's that's kind of my uh my thoughts there but anyway
13:00
I hope I hope that made a little bit of sense there oh yeah it did it did and
13:11
a little guy saying right so so what you're telling me
13:16
is maybe a new gold
13:22
yeah yeah well if they're done if they're done correctly yeah I mean 100 it's like if you can if you can make and
13:29
and again it does beg the question of you know whether whether reducing carbon and like how much carbon do you actually want to reduce do you actually want to
13:35
go all the way to zero because if you go all the way to zero with no alternative energy source or what have you you're going to be in a lot of trouble uh
13:42
you're gonna end up like Sri Lanka you're gonna end up like you know I don't know South Africa is maybe not a good example right now but Sri Lanka is
13:47
definitely a good example there you don't want to you know you have to almost it you have to question the whole
13:54
basis of the scheme itself where you know if it and again uh sorry to go on the tangent Justin but I think it's something that's worth noting something
14:00
potentially that you know refi can also potentially address um but take a second to consider that the whole reason why we have all these
14:05
like the whole purpose of carbon and credits is is to you know is to reduce the damage on the or I guess um lower
14:13
the damage that humans are doing to the environment basically um but if you really think about it the whole reason why we have all this damage
14:18
to the environment is because of over consumption and over consumption comes from the incentive in an in inflationary
14:24
currencies that are losing value there's an incentive to spend if you had a currency that actually held as a value
14:29
you over time then you would be incentivized to save rather than spend you would only spend on the absolute Necessities consumption would come down
14:35
naturally you wouldn't have to pass a single law and and all this you know this this natural reduction in consumption just from this chain to
14:41
Small Change in incentives for making a monetary system that can be inflate that's constantly inflationary versus one that is actually deflationary and of
14:48
course the the you know the powerful people don't want the deflationary system because deflation uh makes debt more expensive and all these governments
14:54
and corporations have a bunch of debt but if you actually want to sell climate change and all these things that that all these uh refi projects ultimately
15:00
want to do then the way you do that is by creating a hard money system a sound money system where there's deflation uh
15:06
that incentivizes people to spend rather than save that reduces the over consumption and you can have a planet with you know five or ten times
15:12
potentially ten times more people and it would be completely fine why because the average person would only consume what they absolutely need to which at the end
15:18
of the day this is what carbon credits are supposed to do too they're incentivizing people not to consume less but you don't have to create this huge
15:24
centralized crazy scheme all you have to do is change the money and that'll fix so many issues whether it's wealth inequality and all these things I truly
15:31
believe because all that all happened is all these again like my mother is Colombian okay so so I I like I I my
15:38
background you know there's there's real poverty in places like Colombia and Latin America and to and and a lot of it
15:44
comes from the fact that they you know at least in places let's say for like El Salvador where they use a foreign currency that's constantly being
15:50
inflated and they just have no chance and anyway but I guess it's a yeah I I
15:55
apologies for the tangent there but I feel free to bring us back on track they're just keep the tangents because
16:00
that's that's that's how that's how I get nuggets whenever people start start talking about things that are passionate
16:06
about that's where that's where nuggets come from right so yeah
16:13
on your last run when everyone on your last bull run right I wrote down I wrote
16:18
down so you know we say that it's hard to kind
16:24
of validate some of these claims that these organizations are saying in terms of carbon credits and I had a call I had
16:30
a call with Uma with Uma yesterday yeah yesterday uh about their optimistic
16:36
Oracle right so although although you know they're using their Oracle primarily for
16:42
prediction markets do you see a place for for or a need for oracles within
16:49
within the sustainability space
16:56
yeah 100 I mean whether whether we're talking carbon credits or nfts or whatever the the name of the game is
17:02
going to be infrastructure so you're gonna need like you said you're gonna need an oracle you're going to need uh somewhere to store the data you know who
17:09
has what uh because you know unfortunately these blockchains some of these blockchains are becoming very big I actually recall and again V chain
17:15
Community feel free to grill meat that I remember last time when we had updated done an update on
17:20
the project um what V chain developers were actually uh they had mentioned an interview that they're concerned that the blockchain is
17:26
becoming too large too quickly and this is what happens to every single crypto project that has a fast transaction speed because what happens is basically
17:33
you're creating uh the size of the blockchain just grows you know I guess you could say like like just very quickly I was going to say exponentially
17:39
but that's not technically correct but in any case um you know decentralized data storage um it would be really interesting I
17:45
think again from refi in this Niche whether it's vechain or otherwise to think like is it possible like you were saying to create
17:52
um even potentially like an oracle they specifically designed for carbon credits is it possible to create a data store a
17:57
decentralized data storage solution that is specifically for the storage of tokenized carbon or of the storage of
18:03
transaction history of tokenized carbon credits um you know to because again like when
18:08
this ties into you know Justin you may or may not be familiar with with Cosmos where the idea behind Cosmos is that
18:14
every single application is eventually going to need need its own blockchain because it's gonna have too much adoption I think that the same thing
18:20
applies to infrastructure where you know everyone assumes oh we're going to use chain link but Nola and like you know everyone's going to use chain link and
18:26
there's no room for competition that's I'm sorry but that's BS what's going to happen is that over time there's gonna be so much data there's going to be so
18:32
much demand for infrastructure that you're going to need you're going to need an Uma with with this optimistic um uh with this optimistic Oracle you're
18:39
gonna need uh some you're going to need probably dozens probably hundreds of oracles and you're gonna and and you
18:45
know rather than just having a chain for each dap someday you might actually need a decentralized storage solution and an
18:51
Oracle and all these other you know um uh node hosting Services stuff like anchor and and these projects which
18:57
Escape me now but you know you're like the the potential in refi uh in my again
19:03
in my opinion comes fundamentally from the building of infrastructure if projects can build infrastructure and focus less less so on tokenizing like
19:10
because anyone like tokenizing the carbon credit that's the easy part that's the get rich quick and fast part if you want something that's gonna
19:15
that's gonna last and something that's actually going to have use uh then creating a custom Oracle for refi
19:21
creating a custom or uh decentralized data storage solution and what have you that I think that's where the potential
19:27
is and I'm not sure if that's something that Uma is seeking to address but um but that's something potentially looking uh worth looking into as a refi project
19:34
yeah I like that I love I love that one yeah so yeah
19:40
so any anything anything else we cover we covered up we covered a lot we covered a lot I'm gonna have to come
19:47
back and and transcribe and transcribe this interview this was that this was a good one
19:52
um do you have anything else you wanted to add in terms of you know how we can bring how we can actually leverage
19:58
blockchain to to assist in this sustainability effort that everybody
20:04
talks about because you know when we talk about sustainability I've been in this space a lot I've created
20:10
I've created a I created a uh uh uh uh a course for for University of Southern California for their new sustainability
20:17
program and over the last couple of years it's just a lot of talk in terms of sustainability
20:23
in terms of reducing you know reducing carbon emission becoming carbon negative and things like that you know so
20:30
something I'm very passionate about and again I came I come from the industry so I know I know a lot of this stuff is
20:36
just talk so I think that maybe maybe I'm just being too optimistic where I'm
20:41
saying if we if you're saying you're gonna do it put on a blockchain and prove it right you know so that's always
20:48
kind of been because my Mantra so you know do you have anything else to add to to
20:55
or any other thoughts to how we can leverage this and it doesn't have to be blockchain how we can leverage
21:00
technology to kind of move more toward um this this this this this Vision that
21:08
we all that we all look to to uh
21:13
well uh I don't know if you know this uh Justin but Solana the founder of Salon I guess creator of Salon I know there's
21:19
technically co-founders whatever um uh Anatolia is actually also really passionate about addressing
21:25
environmental issues through blockchain and cryptocurrency and I think he mentioned an interview once that uh you know if he wasn't doing Solana then he
21:31
would be trying to do something basically in refine it uh and what's what's really fascinating to me is that
21:36
I think that there's potential again like the the crypto industry and I guess this relates to another discussion that
21:43
we had earlier but the crypto industry I think has to has to think less about trying to integrate with existing
21:48
because again the like you were saying like the existing systems of addressing things like sustainability it's mostly
21:53
talk and not much gets done why would why anyone would want to integrate with such a system and again of course the
21:59
reason why they want to integrate is because they want to make money quickly because there's all these you know um government uh spending programs or
22:04
whatever that are going towards the sector so that people can get paid to basically sit around and talk and do nothing but I mean I hope that that's
22:10
not coming up as uh too aggressive but if you if you if you were to change I
22:15
guess like again don't don't like the crypto industry can't think that of like going in and integrating with the
22:21
existing system I I truly believe that the whole point of crypto is to create Alternatives that that will actually disrupt and address these issues so when
22:27
it comes to something like sustainability I do think that there is a potential for you know for for a crypto project whether it's a block
22:33
whether it's refi or what have you even something a great example actually which you may or may not may not have heard about is something like algorand where
22:40
uh on the algorithm blockchain the the um the validators actually don't earn any block rewards uh and so these so or
22:47
transaction fees so what happens to these transaction fees is they basically get sent to like a random wallet address
22:53
and they just sit there and they do nothing uh and what the AL Grant Foundation decided uh or I don't know
22:58
the algorithm Community you know I don't want to put words in their mouth but what they decided to do was to use these transaction fees to actually buy carbon
23:03
credits to make the algor and blockchain carbon neutral which is you know a clever way of doing it but now imagine imagine a scenario where you could take
23:10
a portion of transaction fees from something like ethereum and you could use that to build the solar farm or build a wind farm or ideally build a
23:16
nuclear power plant that is actually safe because again you know everyone is you know really paranoid about uh
23:21
nuclear but you have to remember and Justin you probably know this that there was a huge breakthrough in Fusion uh recently uh right yeah Fusion infusion
23:28
nuclear there's a huge breakthrough and they're saying oh it's going to be it's gonna be another 10 years before we see it why you want you want to know why
23:34
because there's there's all this regulation there's all this tape there's too many people in rooms discussing how
23:39
they're going to do it whatever what you if if Fusion is known to be something that is safe to experiment with which I
23:45
don't know if it is but let's just say for sake of argument that it is then you could have a cryptocurrent you could have a dow you could have a refi Dao uh
23:52
pull all this money together to create a fusion reactor in the next couple years instead of in a couple decades and you
23:57
could get started on on going to you know on reducing carbon emissions in like in you know immediately and and
24:02
people forget one thing sorry to go on attention again here at Justin but one thing that people forget is that it's
24:08
not just about the money it's it's about the time imagine if you were able to build a fusion reactor you know
24:13
crowdfund the development of a fusion Reactor with the cryptocurrency in two or three years and then you have seven
24:18
years of that of that Fusion reactor basically creating Limitless amounts of energy versus waiting that extra seven
24:24
years and then making it you know what I mean the the gains that would be had in those seven years leading up would just be so incredible for all of society and
24:31
so crypto has to stop thinking it's like oh how do we how do we backpack and get you know get more of this like Fiat
24:36
money from these institutions that again like you know in my opinion that money is eventually going to be worth nothing anyway uh you know radical radical
24:43
thought but you know why not instead focus on why don't we crowdfund and build something why don't we build what
24:48
just just build like a like a solar farm buy some land and build a solar farm buy some land buy some land and build the
24:54
wind farm see how it works and actually have some Financial incentives why not make it that whoever buys energy from
24:59
this wind farm that money goes to the people who have participated in the doubt who participating in the crowdfunding why the hell do we need all these energy companies why the hell do
25:05
we need all these governments to say you know of course there needs to be some regulation don't get me wrong but why do
25:10
we need all this conflict infrastructure and and bureaucracy like why why don't you just crowdfund it and build it yourself and then have the profits come
25:17
to the Dow and then you can use that money to build it and keep building and keep building and keep building and build another Fusion reactor and another
25:22
solar and start building solar panels in space like all this you know reach out to Elon Elon loves Dogecoin why don't
25:27
you make some solar panels send them up to space you could crowdfund that you know of course individually we're all
25:32
you know each of us you know relative to the people who are really wealthy relative to the central Bankers for sure individually we don't have much money
25:39
but if we pool together and we push that money in a certain direction then then what we can do we can do it faster and
25:44
better and this is something that Anatoly sees and all these other guys see and and I imagine a lot of guys in the refi industry also see this that if
25:50
we can work collectively collectively together and on the same page we can whatever what the governments are kind of planning now with all these Green New
25:56
Deals or whatever we can do it faster and better and more transparently and everything through through blockchain if if we just stop focusing on trying to
26:03
jump on that bandwagon is oh I want money from the Green New Deal too no make your own Green New Deal let's work
26:08
together let's do it together and let's have it done you know in a couple years or a couple months instead of a good
26:13
decade right anyway I hope that's a good uh note to end on oh yes it is yes it is
26:18
all right so that was the last note but I have one more question what do you think what do you think are
26:24
the future of Dallas because you brought it up and you brought up a good point into you brought up a good point in a a good use case for Dallas
26:32
in my opinion I don't I don't I don't think that some Adele like that may gain traction because I we're dealing with
26:39
people here right we're still dealing with people I don't think people will see there's enough money in it so like that in this
26:46
case you mentioned may not may not have legs and that's a perfect use case for it now so so so in your opinion how far
26:55
how far out do you think that we are away from and we're talking about this in the bear market right in the book
27:01
Market they're saying oh Dallas of the future but now that we've seen what happened with these dolls
27:06
what are your thoughts on dials and the future of Dallas uh um in short I think this is going to
27:15
sound pretty horrible but I think that I think that unless we find a new governance structure then all Dows are
27:20
going to fail I I know that's a bold prediction to make but um I want you to imagine because right now the way that
27:27
the way that Dows are set up is that they're set up in kind of like a democratic process and the democracy is that one token equals one vote uh which
27:34
is not a very good democracy because of course the wealthiest I don't know if you saw this headline I think it's something like 97 or something like
27:39
three percent of the token holders of like 97 of the voting power some have seen her 87 some have seen a imbalance
27:46
in voting power but even even if you were to do a system which of course they're trying to develop now is to you know you have like a decentralized
27:52
digital ID where it's like one person equals one vote you have a you know direct democracy the same way you do
27:57
um you know in some countries then you then you run into the same issue because where where are all the decisions in the
28:03
united well I guess the United States is a different situation because you have States and all the stuff but for sake of argument it's like all the power in the
28:09
United Kingdom is concentrated in London all the power most of the power in the United States is concentrated in Washington so if you create Dows with
28:16
them with you know Democratic systems or totalitarian systems or or a dictatorship you're going to end up with
28:21
you're eventually going to end up with the same centralization and issues that we see today so we not only have to decentralized so Dows not only need to
28:27
decentralize you know the participation they need to decentralize the structure itself otherwise you're just gonna the the the the the the the the the uh I
28:35
guess the process of Dao voting is is inherently centralizing and that is going to lead to failure over time
28:40
because you're going to end up with with a group of people that have a lot of influence and you saw this recently with the Venture capitalists fighting back
28:45
and forth and uh so what I personally think needs to happen is we need to have a new governance structure and I
28:51
actually came up with one and I'll I'll save that I guess for another discussion but but uh but I came up with a governance structure that is neither
28:56
Democratic nor um nor dictatorial because those are kind of like the two extremes uh but there is a way there is a middle ground
29:02
that you can have um where you can have a new governance structure and if daos can Implement something along those lines uh then as
29:09
long like again the the whole purpose of of an organization if the organization has bad governance then the organization
29:15
is doomed to fail the way that Dows are structured today they are all doomed to fail they're all doomed to fail and I'm
29:20
going to say that with 100 boldness uh so there needs to be a change yeah on that front anyway that's uh
29:28
that was that was excellent that was a great that was a great way to end in this conversation so Daniel thank you
29:34
once again thank you once again for all this can you let everybody know where they can find you
29:39
yeah yeah just find me on LinkedIn uh Daniel krupka um you can also follow me on Twitter but
29:45
if there's some spicy stuff on there so don't get offended um I mean feel free to reach out and we'll have you and I'm a busy guy but uh
29:51
if you manage to get a hold of me then consider yourself lucky oh and I can attest to that one I can
29:57
attest to that one myself all right so once again once again thank you thank
30:04
you for for taking the time and everyone else until next time thanks

Dr Justin Goldston here and we're back
0:06
this time we are back with Tom raftery
0:09
long long time friend of mine we hadn't
0:12
we hadn't talked in a while so I'm very
0:13
upset but but Tom Tom can you introduce
0:17
yourself and talk about what you do
0:19
within the sustainability and comment
0:21
space sure Happy Days thanks Justin so
0:24
this is a space I've been in actively
0:27
for
0:28
oh 15 years at least maybe a little more
0:32
um I I got into it profession it was it
0:35
was always an area of interest because
0:36
I'm a biologist by training
0:39
um even though I work in the technology
0:40
space now I went I did biology in
0:43
University went on while studying for a
0:46
PhD in biology I was doing a PhD on
0:49
biological control I never quite
0:51
finished it because I got distracted by
0:53
technology and there was a whole lot
0:55
more money to be made on the Technology
0:57
field than there was in biology but it's
0:58
always there in my heart you know I'm
1:01
I'm a I'm a biologist and a technologist
1:03
in my two passions so I got into the
1:07
kind of energy and sustainability space
1:09
in around 2006 professionally when I got
1:12
to design and build out a data center in
1:16
Cork in Ireland where I lived at the
1:17
time and we completely optimized the
1:21
Data Center for Energy Efficiency we
1:24
made it a hyper energy efficient data
1:25
center because we wanted it to be as low
1:27
carbon as possible and I started giving
1:29
a lot of talks about that at the time
1:30
and got a name for myself in the green
1:32
energy space and then after that I was
1:36
taken on by an industry analyst firm to
1:39
head up their arm which dealt with
1:43
energy and sustainability so I led
1:45
research in that and we turned that
1:48
organization green Monk and I led that
1:51
for seven years and then
1:53
I was recruited into sap in 2016
1:56
as an iot evangelist but I had a heavy
1:59
kind of side of sustainability in that
2:02
as well so I've been working really at
2:05
the kind of the the intersection of
2:07
technology and sustainability for well
2:09
since 2016 however many years that isn't
2:12
terrible at maths
2:13
sorry sorry 2006 so that's what that's
2:16
17 years 17 years yeah yeah that's
2:18
that's that's a while it's a whole lot
2:20
her a lot earlier than than where a lot
2:22
of people were talking about in terms of
2:24
sustainability whenever they want to
2:26
happen on sustainability bandwagon you
2:28
know right before covert it kind of
2:30
coincides with the
2:32
um algor Inconvenient Truth movie that
2:36
came out around that time as well which
2:37
did raise an awareness of the issue back
2:41
around the 2006 time frame but then with
2:44
the economic crash in 2008 it all went
2:46
away again and it only started to Bubble
2:48
back up again after Paris in 2015 I
2:50
think okay excellent so so I know before
2:55
thank you for that I know before you
2:58
know our discussion you know we I asked
3:00
a question about you know what what work
3:02
you've done in terms of carbon emissions
3:03
and carbon credits and carbon offsets
3:06
and you said that you've you've you've
3:08
interviewed a couple of interesting
3:09
people on your podcast can you expand on
3:12
that a little bit sure yeah so I have
3:15
two podcasts I have one called the
3:16
digital supply chain podcast and I like
3:19
to have a bit of a focus on
3:20
sustainability in that uh and I've uh in
3:24
that I've uh talked to several
3:27
blockchain companies in fact who are in
3:30
the space of you know visibility for
3:32
things uh be it Agriculture and
3:36
visibility of food those kind of things
3:38
and then I have a second podcast which
3:41
is the climate confident podcast and in
3:43
that I've done a lot around well the the
3:46
whole
3:47
aim or the mission statement which is
3:50
very lofty term I guess of the climate
3:52
confident podcast is to highlight
3:54
successful emissions reduction stories
3:57
and strategies to kind of
4:00
excite people and Inspire them to take
4:03
action as well so uh in that space I
4:06
have talked to people who are in the uh
4:10
the offset space definitely and
4:12
obviously the emission space
4:15
interesting interesting so so based on
4:19
those discussions I've lost your audio
4:21
Justin I'm not hearing you can you hear
4:23
me can you hear me now
4:24
give me try something here yeah
4:33
what about what about now
4:35
yep taking your email and you could can
4:37
you do you hear me the whole time yeah I
4:39
can hear your whole time
4:40
okay good yeah okay I can hear you again
4:43
it was I think a loose cable on my on
4:45
the side of my machine there okay
Challenges
4:47
so so based on based on those interviews
4:49
based on your experiences
4:52
um what would be what would be some of
4:54
the challenges
4:57
um what will be some of the challenges
4:58
also what would be some of the benefits
5:00
to to tracking carbon emissions carbon
5:03
credits or Carbon offsets on the
5:05
blockchain in your opinion
5:07
yeah so they're very different so
5:10
tracking carbon emissions is something
5:12
that every organization is going to have
5:15
to do
5:17
um it's it's going to be regulated
5:20
um the SEC came out with proposals last
5:24
year that all publicly traded companies
5:25
will have to start reporting their
5:27
emissions from 2024 depending on the
5:31
size large ones first and then smaller
5:34
ones after that but in in by 2025 all
5:37
publicly traded companies will have to
5:39
report their emissions now these were
5:41
proposals that the SEC but they haven't
5:42
come into a force yet they were put out
5:45
for discussion but it would it it talks
5:48
to a direction of travel because you
5:50
have similar regulations bubbling up in
5:52
Europe as well and it all as we get
5:54
closer to 2030 and we're not getting our
5:57
emissions reductions targets by 2030
6:00
that's going to start to become more and
6:02
more of an issue and we will soon start
6:04
to see every region start to require
6:06
companies to report their emissions and
6:09
of course to report your missions you
6:11
need to be tracking them so this is
6:12
going to be a big thing absolutely
6:15
tracking and Reporting missions going to
6:16
be huge in fact the SEC and their
6:18
proposals last year said that the the
6:21
reporting would have to be out to scope
6:22
three and they would have to be audited
6:25
so you know
6:27
all the big accounting firms are rubbing
6:30
their hands with Glee and everyone is
6:32
kind of scratching their heads because
6:33
no one knows yet how to report out of
6:35
scope 3 those standards haven't been in
6:37
place so there's a lot of people talking
6:38
about that and trying to come up with
6:40
standards for that reporting
6:43
the offsets piece is
6:47
different and it's more challenging if
6:50
reporting of the scope 3 wasn't
6:52
challenging enough the offsets one is
6:53
even more challenging because
6:55
it's hard to track but also there's a
6:58
huge amount of green washing going on on
7:00
that space
7:02
um and that that's going to be one of
7:03
the hardest ones and it's not just the
7:05
green washing it's also the quality of
7:07
the offsets I mean if I
7:11
invest in offsets in a forest in the
7:16
Amazon
7:17
and there's a wildfire and it burns down
7:20
you know what happens to my offsets or
7:23
uh you know a a
7:27
forest in California doesn't have to be
7:29
the Amazon or southeast Asia uh you know
7:32
and it gets logged illegally you know
7:34
you know there you go the offsets Up and
7:36
Smoke as it were
7:38
um so these kind of things mean that a
7:41
lot of the offsets are of
7:45
my my questionable quality I guess or
7:48
could potentially be and so the the
7:51
verification and tracking of those is
7:54
going to be really really really
7:55
important
7:57
um
7:57
and the forestry ones are some of the
8:01
most
8:02
dubious I would say there are others
8:05
though enhanced weathering for example
8:07
is one and some of the nature-based
8:10
solutions that that you know are around
8:13
investing in biodiversity for example
8:15
they're in interesting as well they're a
8:18
lot harder to measure but they are ones
8:22
that
8:24
um have a greater
8:26
potential outcome now as I say the
8:28
measurement of that is very challenging
8:29
there I don't think there's any agreed
8:31
standard around measuring biodiversity
8:33
for example so that's going to be a hard
8:34
one to track
8:36
uh there's been some great stuff come
8:39
out of the IMF and RAV shami who's an
8:41
assistant director of the IMF in
8:43
particular on the on on putting a
8:47
monetary value on the carbon
8:49
sequestration services that are
8:52
performed by the likes of whales and
8:55
elephants Forest elephants and that's an
8:58
interesting one he's working with an
9:00
organization called rebalance Earth to
9:02
try and do that on a blockchain uh
9:05
they're working with uh the Gabon the
9:09
country Gabon they're working with the
9:11
government there to
9:14
put a financial value on the
9:18
carbon sequestration Services performed
9:20
by elephants Forest elephants and the
9:23
Gabon and then allow companies to invest
9:26
in those track it on a blockchain and
9:29
make sure that the money goes to
9:32
projects in the area to help local
9:35
communities as opposed to going into the
9:37
pockets of politicians
9:41
yeah so I just yeah I just received I
9:45
just received uh thank you for that I
9:48
just received a text through Linkedin
9:49
one of my
Carbon offsets
9:51
what am I one of my researching peers
9:53
Daniel Daniel krupka from um from uh
9:57
coin coin bureau if you're watching
9:59
shout out but um he sent me a message
10:02
yesterday more than nine percent of of
10:05
rainforest carbon offsets Bob biggest
10:07
certifier Vera are worthless that's
10:10
right yeah I saw that that report came
10:12
out last week or the week before and
10:14
that's that's that talks to what I'm
10:15
talking about a lot of times if you're
10:17
investing in Forest offsets it could be
10:19
for the forest it was never going to be
10:21
cut down anyway that it was there was an
10:23
existing one uh you know and there's a
10:26
lot of dubious claims made about the the
10:27
forestry ones so you'd I mean the the
10:31
the organization there was supposed to
10:34
be a an organization that verified and
10:38
had a good name and suddenly it turns
10:40
out 90 of their offsets are
10:42
worthless is probably a strong term but
10:45
of dubious quality certainly
DeFi vs Refi
10:50
yeah yeah so
10:52
yeah and that's one thing I mean we're
10:55
trying we're trying to do our best in
10:56
this in this area but you're always
10:58
going to be in my opinion fighting an
11:00
uphill battle because you know there's
11:02
there's Financial there's monetary gain
11:04
you know in this area so so whenever you
11:07
may you may you made a point you know at
11:09
the introduction where
11:12
you know there was more money to be made
11:14
in the tech field which is absolutely
11:16
accurate so that leads me into another
11:19
question of
11:20
given that because like in blockchain we
11:22
have D5 everybody goes over to D5
11:25
because that's where all of money that's
11:26
the financial incentive within within
11:28
the blockchain space right there's the
11:30
money to be made in defy right so so
11:33
there's also there's also a refi space
11:35
that kind of looks in looks at that
11:38
climate Finance aspect to make a
11:40
positive difference right so
11:43
given that you know going back what you
11:44
said there's more money to be made in in
11:46
the tech space there's more money to be
11:48
made in D5 how could we convince people
11:52
to move over to the refi area because
11:56
there is more
11:58
sustainable benefit we can go deeper all
12:01
day long but the world may not be here
12:03
in 20 years right we need to go to the
12:06
refi space so we can have a world to
12:08
live in I mean that's just my that's my
12:10
that's my views I mean what's your
12:11
thoughts on that yeah no it's it's a
12:13
good point
12:14
um I think
12:16
the
12:18
Global decarbonization project that
12:22
we're going to have to go through
12:24
is the largest project Humanity will
12:28
ever ever undertake which means there's
12:31
going to be
12:34
truckloads of money the likes of which
12:36
we've never seen before go into it so
12:38
there's a massive opportunity here for
12:41
everyone
12:42
the
12:45
important thing is to make sure that the
12:47
money goes to the right types of
12:48
projects
12:50
the first thing is we need
12:53
to decarbonize everything as much as
12:56
possible there are some Industries where
13:00
that's easier than others the software
13:02
industry is very simple to decarbonize
13:04
the
13:06
glass steel
13:09
aluminum chemicals Industries uh
13:13
Aviation Industries they're extremely
13:16
difficult to decarbonize and so for them
13:19
where they can't decarbonize they will
13:22
need to purchase offsets
13:25
uh but they'll have to get so the idea
13:28
is to get as much carbon out of the
13:30
system as possible and for the remainder
13:32
use offsets and the offsets should be a
13:35
place of Last Resort
13:37
and then those offsets need to be
13:41
verifiable they need to be able to show
13:43
that they're not green wash they need to
13:45
be able to show that they are actually
13:48
beneficial and with
13:50
there's going to fire anyone that can do
13:53
that
13:54
verifiably then I I see it as a big
13:58
market and that should be somewhere
13:59
where the refi folks can say look we've
14:02
got this space it's a it's an enormous
14:05
Market because even if I said it should
14:07
be the the place of Last Resort the
14:09
offsets it's still a massive Last Resort
14:12
you know it'll be the biggest Financial
14:13
undertaking the planet has ever seen or
14:16
Humanity has ever undertaken
14:18
yeah and so
Climate Finance on VeChain
14:21
that was an excellent answer by the way
14:23
so so I I spoke with I spoke with two
14:27
people in this space
14:29
um so I spoke with I spoke with Drew
14:31
from spoken through from um from uh
14:34
clementell and then I spoke with another
14:37
individual I spoke with another
14:39
individual from toucan protocol and
14:42
they were saying that
14:45
in terms of moving an entire
14:48
industry or an entire space from the web
14:51
2 world to the web 3 world this climate
14:54
Finance is probably one of the only ones
14:56
where you could move the entire because
14:58
it's a three-bit it's a two or three
14:59
billion dollar industry something like
15:00
that right so you could actually move
15:03
that whole entire that whole entire
15:05
carbon credit space on the blockchain
15:07
you can move it on chain right because
15:09
there's a small number of people that
15:12
are controlling these things and then
15:13
you can work with those people because
15:15
they actually do work with those people
15:16
and they can move the whole entire space
15:18
on chain right now now with it with the
15:21
real estate industry Global real estate
15:23
industry that would be impossible right
15:26
but people are trying to do it and then
15:29
further and also it's going to take a
15:30
long long time to actually do that right
15:32
so
15:34
if you're if we're able to move you know
15:37
let's just say you know the carbon
15:38
credit the the carbon credit tracking if
15:40
we're able to move that whole entire
15:42
space on chain do you think that we're
15:45
going to
15:47
minimize this whole green washing space
15:50
we're going to provide more value within
15:52
this space and if it's if it's if it's
15:54
transparent if it's transparent do you
15:56
think more money will pour in because
15:59
now everybody can see everything on
16:01
chain
16:03
that's the Hope isn't it I mean it is
16:07
I mean really
16:08
one thing to be aware of though Justin
16:10
is yeah it's it is only a I think you
16:15
said two or three billion dollar
16:17
industry today yeah
16:19
but it's at like
16:21
minuscule numbers compared to where it
16:24
needs to be
16:26
so the amount of I don't I don't know
16:29
the exact numbers okay but the amount of
16:32
carbon that we're going to have to
16:34
offset will be in the tens of billions
16:38
of tons per year
16:42
and we're doing maybe tens of thousands
16:47
today maybe maybe a million so we have
16:51
got to get from the maybe one million
16:53
maybe two million tons that we're doing
16:55
today up to literally tens of billions
16:58
of tons per year
17:00
for it to make a significant impact so
17:02
this is a space that's going to grow
17:04
enormously and
17:07
because it has a
17:11
reputation uh for being mixed up with
17:14
greenwashing absolutely it needs to be
17:17
it needs it needs some mechanism whether
17:20
it's blockchain or something else it
17:22
needs some mechanism to show look hey
17:25
we're 100 transparent you can check
17:27
every single aspect of this you know
17:29
from start to finish
17:31
and if if it if you can show that
17:35
then it starts to then its reputation
17:37
starts to be repaired
17:39
and people are less dubious about
17:41
stepping into the space
17:44
so that's that's a good that's a good
Digital Transformation
17:47
segue into into the last question which
17:50
I Hope's last question so given that
17:53
given that organizations primarily
17:55
within the supply chain space because
17:57
that's that's the space that I play in
17:59
you know given that they're going to be
18:01
required to to uh publish you know their
18:04
their tracking and greenhouse gases and
18:07
things like that
18:09
what do you think is going to be the
18:12
digital transformation strategy or the
18:16
implementation path for large
18:19
organizations as well as small and
18:21
medium organizations
18:23
um
18:24
it's a good question and it'll vary with
18:28
different organizations in different
18:30
Industries
18:31
um I did a an interview recently in my
18:35
Clement confident podcast with a guy
18:37
called Luis Amaral and Luis is the CEO
18:40
of an organization called the
18:41
science-based targets initiative and
18:44
what they do is they're they're
18:46
non-profit they work with companies to
18:49
say
18:51
you know and any company can say ah
18:53
we're going to be Net Zero by 2050 or
18:56
2040 or whatever it is and you know you
18:59
put that on your CSR report and you put
19:02
that on your annual report and everyone
19:03
claps and then nothing happens
19:05
but the science-based target initiative
19:07
does is it works with companies to say
19:10
okay
19:12
Baseline this is where you are today in
19:14
terms of emissions
19:17
here's where you need to get to to be
19:19
Net Zero using science-based principles
19:24
and they have different templates for
19:26
different Industries and you work with
19:28
them to roll to to publicize the steps
19:32
you're going to take to go from where
19:34
you are today
19:35
to being Net Zero by whatever date you
19:37
set
19:39
generally it's around 2030.
19:41
and you do verification steps for that
19:45
pathway as well
19:46
and so
19:48
it's things like this it's
19:50
setting science-based targets measuring
19:55
and Reporting against them is the most
19:58
important thing organizations will need
20:00
to do and I would be surprised if in the
20:02
next few years they're not mandated to
20:04
do
20:06
yeah I can't know that I know that we um
20:10
we just updated we just updated a Class
20:12
A CSR class at Georgetown so I'm
20:15
actually an Advisory board at Georgetown
20:16
and uh we we were updating the CSR class
20:20
and the director brought in brought in
20:22
this whole aspect of science-based
20:24
targets where a lot of people with the
20:26
because like Georgetown the government
20:28
government speaks with Georgetown a lot
20:31
in terms of the research just going on
20:32
and then the government actually brought
20:33
in the idea of you know what are y'all
20:35
doing in terms of science-based Target
20:36
research so that's one question that
20:39
that the that the government is bringing
20:40
in so you might have a good point where
20:42
it may be required you know so
20:46
I think it will I think in some in some
20:48
regions certainly I would be surprised
20:51
if Europe doesn't bring in that
20:52
legislation in the next two three years
20:54
and depending I guess on the outcome of
20:57
the next election in the U.S uh it might
20:59
happen there too
21:01
yeah so so yeah so that's pretty much
21:04
all the questions that I had
21:07
um this was very very beneficial uh so
21:10
can you let everyone know where they can
21:12
find you absolutely so as you said at
21:15
the start my name is Tom raftery I have
21:17
a website tomraftery.com I have a
21:20
Twitter account at Tom raftery I'm easy
21:23
to find on LinkedIn as well there's not
21:24
a lot of Tom rafter he's on LinkedIn I
21:26
have my Clement confident podcast and my
21:29
digital supply chain podcast both of
21:31
which are available on any podcast app
21:34
that you go to just look for digital
21:36
supply chain podcast or climate
21:37
confident podcasts and Booms they'll
21:39
come straight up
21:41
and I would I would suggest to everyone
21:43
log in or subscribe to those podcasts
21:46
because they're absolutely amazing if
21:48
you're in a sustainability or common
21:49
action space all right thank you so much
21:52
um and Justin you're an alumnus Justin
21:54
of the digital supply chain podcast I
21:55
had you on the podcast there a year or
21:57
more back at this point I think yep yep
22:00
yep and that was that was that was one
22:01
that was one of the great one of the
22:03
best podcasts one of the best podcasts
22:05
may not be may not be the top viewed but
22:08
you know what yeah it's number one
22:10
number one in our hearts
22:12
foreign
22:15
thanks for your time thank you so much
22:18
Justin all right see you everyone


VeChain Foundation Climate Research - Justin Goldston Interviews Drew Bonneau of KlimaDAO

Video Link: https://youtu.be/9fXhRMkdPlc

hi everyone
0:04
um in this discussion we're going to to
0:06
just to be talking with uh Drew from
0:09
Cleveland from Cleveland Dale
0:11
um and we're going to see how we can how
0:13
we can bring in Cleveland now from to
0:16
kind of provide cross-chain Solutions
0:19
um so Drew you want to introduce
0:20
yourself
0:22
sure I think thanks Justin so I'm Drew
0:24
I'm leading uh Partnerships at Queen I
0:28
have about eight years of experience in
0:29
the finance space I've worked with
0:31
carbon project development and financing
0:33
I've also worked with some tech
0:35
companies uh doing different Innovative
0:37
things with monitoring reporting and
0:39
verification using different remote
0:41
sensing Technologies uh and I've also
0:43
just doing it at a cardinal set Trader
0:44
in the Market along with renewable
0:47
energy certificates and things of that
0:48
nature so yeah excited uh just to speak
0:52
about what Cleveland I was doing
0:54
um we've been in the market for about
0:56
a year and a half now I suppose uh we're
0:59
one of the largest Builders of carbon
1:00
liquidity uh in the blockchain space is
1:02
about 25 million tons of tokenized or
1:05
digitized carbon offsets that have made
1:07
their way to the polygon blockchain and
1:09
claiming I was building a variety of
1:11
different tooling and
1:13
um it's like building the infrastructure
1:15
layer for different applications to tap
1:17
into that carbon liquidity and build
1:19
unique applications with digital
1:21
cardboard that's me
1:23
excellent I appreciate that so can you
1:26
can you kind of expand on why you all
1:29
chose polygon
1:31
certainly
1:33
um so one of the uh key benefits I think
1:36
uh of blockchain technology in the kind
1:39
of climate spaces is in particular with
1:42
public blockchains right so of course
1:43
there's a variety of different
1:44
blockchains um but we we chose polygon
1:48
because there is a very
1:50
um let's take an active developer
1:52
Community uh it's an evm compatible
1:54
chain which is a plus there's a lot of
1:56
evm developers already and uh it's
1:59
really important to have let's say a
2:00
very vibrant default Community or
2:02
decentralized finance that can build
2:04
different types of interoperable
2:06
applications together because I think
2:07
that that's how we really spur on
2:09
innovation in this industry is when
2:11
people can build together like that so
2:13
you want a chain where there's a lot
2:14
going on there
2:16
um the other piece is that polygon in
2:18
comparison to other uh l2's or polygon
2:22
through food safe is technically like a
2:24
side chain
2:25
um they do have some true Healthy
2:27
Solutions in the pipeline
2:29
um but the other condition with them is
2:32
that they've had tremendous traction
2:33
with pins to corporate adoption right a
2:36
lot of that right now is just marketing
2:37
efforts and doing some interesting
2:39
things with mot projects and such but
2:41
then it's not so much of a leap for
2:42
these corporates to say okay we're
2:44
already using polygon for you know
2:46
project XYZ
2:48
let's also start to use them for some of
2:50
our ESG initiatives and tap into that
2:53
chain and the infrastructure there uh
2:55
for sourcing different types of
2:56
environmental assets
2:59
excellent excellent so so
3:02
given that we're trying to to bring in
3:05
bring in the masses we're trying to
3:09
bring in Enterprises right what current
3:12
what current challenges do you see
3:14
within the climate within a climate
3:17
Finance space and adoption
3:20
yeah so this is a really really
3:23
important part
3:24
um
3:25
for what we're trying to do and that's
3:26
the interfacing challenge right I think
3:28
decentralized Finance generally really
3:30
has this challenge with with the
3:32
interface um we can't expect corporates
3:35
and really just the majority of users to
3:37
create let's say a web 3 wallet use
3:39
metamask you know sign into an
3:42
application do everything like that you
3:44
have to make the experience more let's
3:46
say what you like but they're
3:48
comfortable logging in with an email you
3:50
know maybe using two-factor
3:51
authentication being able to see the
3:53
different types of blockchain-based
3:55
assets they have be able to send
3:57
transactions easily in a verified manner
3:59
that that's that's really crucial that's
4:01
some of one of the points that I was
4:04
working on with our partners
4:05
um but you know I think it's kind of
4:07
like where the internet is out in
4:08
Mindless
4:10
um before web browsers became more
4:12
intuitive and everything
4:14
um I think in the next year or two
4:16
people won't even realize that
4:18
interacting with Watson right it's just
4:20
all going to be abstract the way that's
4:22
really the direction we need to go to to
4:23
get Mass adoption
4:25
okay okay so
4:28
so all right so once we once we get to
4:31
once we get to adoption because I think
4:34
that
4:35
you've had the discussion of you know
4:37
based on the use case everything doesn't
4:39
have to be on the blockchain right but
4:42
in terms of in terms of you know
4:46
carbon offsets you know Carbon you know
4:49
Carbon emissions tracking what do you
4:51
think are are the benefits of utilizing
4:54
of utilizing blockchain
5:00
yeah so we um I think like clearly
5:02
Dallas approach this is in uh unique
5:05
necessarily uh institutions like the
5:07
World Bank have cited the benefit of
5:09
blockchain and I've seen it as a uh
5:12
let's say an inappropriate technology to
5:14
apply to the climate Sciences well why
5:16
is that um blockchain really provides
5:18
unprecedented transparency and
5:21
traceability of different types of
5:22
assets and it can be done in a way where
5:26
you have essentially neutral
5:27
infrastructure that's doing this that a
5:29
variety of different stakeholders can
5:31
both monitor but then also interact with
5:34
so I think this goes back then to this
5:37
idea of having a vibrant D5 developer
5:40
Community if you're all building on
5:43
what's a neutral public infrastructure
5:45
in a trustless manner which blockchain
5:48
provides people can build different
5:50
types of applications together and not
5:52
have to rely on some centralized party
5:54
to ensure that there's
5:56
um
5:57
you know congruency with the data and
5:59
things of that nature and I'll just run
6:00
on the blockchain so I think that's a
6:03
really strong suit the other piece is
6:05
that right now the the voluntary carbon
6:07
Market is is very fragmented
6:10
this trading activity that takes place
6:12
OTC in a very big fashion uh and when
6:15
you can start to move that market
6:16
activity onto a blockchain there are
6:19
interesting Data Insights that I think
6:20
can be empowering to the market which
6:22
simply aren't really possible today
6:23
today if you're looking at let's say
6:26
market analysis of the voluntary Urban
6:28
Market you're relying on retrospective
6:31
often survey based settings
6:33
so you're going to be looking at data
6:35
that's months old right in contrast just
6:38
a very concrete example on this so clean
6:40
it out has the carbon technology Finance
6:43
Market dashboard in in real time we can
6:47
see all the activity taking place from
6:49
different types of digital Urban
6:51
instance so we'll be able to see you
6:54
know what kind of projects are most
6:55
interesting to corporates uh which
6:57
geographies seem to be uh you know
7:00
having having high interest on
7:01
corporates that you're looking to offset
7:03
their carbon and so on all that data
7:05
will be available and I think this is
7:09
excellent so so yeah you were talking
7:11
about you were talking about you know
7:13
bringing bringing devs in to to to your
7:17
to your ecosystem to your protocol so my
7:20
question to you is
7:22
how do you how do you recruit and retain
7:25
devs when there's frankly when there's a
7:28
lot of competition out there across
7:29
within the web 3 space
7:31
I'm very interested in in this one yeah
7:34
yeah
7:35
um well so you know Cleveland is a a
7:37
decentralized autonomous Organization
7:39
for doubt
7:40
um it's the first Dow that I've been a
7:42
part of but it's really interesting to
7:44
see how one would be the the
7:47
transparency of like governance
7:50
decisions how that happens and then also
7:52
through the the tokenomics that
7:54
different contributors of course have
7:55
skin in the game right away because if
7:57
you have to clean the token you can then
8:00
engage in that governance for instance
8:01
do you have a voice right major
8:03
decisions on how funds are allocated and
8:06
the different types of projects that we
8:07
undertake
8:09
um that that that's all very transparent
8:11
there's a clear governance process
8:13
discussions from the community and then
8:15
voting to determine that so it's very uh
8:17
meritocratic I would say as well
8:20
um and that's an interesting piece I
8:23
think is uh attractive to people and to
8:25
town
8:27
the other side is uh just marketing and
8:29
climate Finance right now I think if
8:31
people are looking for something
8:32
meaningful where they can have a real
8:34
impact on it's the future of the planet
8:37
and it's Society in many ways and then
8:39
leverage this new novel technology but
8:42
we're right at the crossword words of
8:44
that right climate that works with the
8:45
interface with
8:46
blockchains so I think that's a strong
8:49
messaging that's something that
8:50
resonates with a lot of people and so
8:51
we've been fortunate to be able to to
8:53
attract a lot of time but
8:55
excellent I like that so so
9:00
how long how long do you think it's
9:03
going to take
9:04
for
9:06
to get this Dow type governance type
9:09
structure for web 2 what we call Web 2
9:13
companies right traditional traditional
9:15
organizations you know how long how long
9:18
do you think it's going it's going to
9:19
take to get the adoption
9:21
yeah
9:24
you know I could see
9:26
um
9:27
yeah I think in nine to 12 months we'll
9:28
have some more industry players that are
9:30
a bit more involved right we've done a
9:31
lot of Education around what it is that
9:33
we're actually doing and this comes back
9:34
to another point of like why why is the
9:37
Dow structure interesting or why is it
9:39
interesting uh the blockchain
9:41
um
9:42
so we're building these different
9:44
infrastructure pieces to facilitate the
9:46
market and the way that we're doing that
9:49
and by building on blockchain all these
9:51
different Market participants can have a
9:53
voice in that but also have let's say
9:55
ownership over that infrastructure right
9:58
and that's something that doesn't exist
9:59
in the traditional market today either
10:01
right it's all uh you know siled
10:05
exchanges centrally controlled
10:08
fragmented in a way we're kind of
10:10
harmonizing all that and then everybody
10:12
can have a voice and if you join now of
10:14
course that's that's the thesis that
10:16
we're after will different actors
10:19
actually want to do that because of
10:20
course there's a lot of competition in
10:21
the market
10:22
um we have to see but the tools that
10:24
we're building we try to be neutral and
10:25
just build an infrastructure layer that
10:27
other people can build on top of
10:29
uh so we'll have to see how much
10:31
adoption there is there the other piece
10:32
is on the regulation Zone let's say
10:35
um
10:35
Wyoming for example like does recognize
10:38
Dao's as a legal uh entity type uh
10:42
there's a few other jurisdictions in the
10:44
world that are starting to do this too I
10:45
think that's important for legitimacy
10:47
and for different players to feel
10:48
comfortable about it yeah
10:50
okay so you said that you've been you've
10:53
been educating people you've been
10:55
educating people on what you all do
10:57
right now are you saying that you've
10:59
been educating traditional companies on
11:01
on what you do
11:03
primarily yeah I mean you know there's
11:05
so much stuff happening with you all
11:07
right and what we're doing though has
11:09
this direct time to I don't know if I
11:12
want to talk like the off chain world or
11:13
the real world whatever it may be you
11:16
know we have to onboard these players in
11:19
the market that have been here for the
11:20
last 20 years uh you know to show them
11:23
how this technology can be used and how
11:25
it can be empowering to what they're
11:27
doing so that is a pretty core mission
11:29
is what we do and that's why
11:31
um most recently we've been hosting this
11:33
webinar series uh called onset we're
11:35
trying to get a lot of Industry players
11:36
in there
11:37
um you know to Showcase to them what it
11:39
is that we're doing and I think the
11:40
first webinar it's titled introduction
11:43
to digital carbon I think that's a great
11:45
resource for people on the market uh to
11:47
take a look at what we're doing and what
11:49
blockchain community
11:50
Okay now what's been what's been the
11:53
feedback what's been the feedback from
11:55
the from the industry
11:57
like what have they been saying because
11:59
I'm curious yeah so I mean you know some
12:03
uh some organizations are pretty
12:06
let's say they're pretty interested and
12:07
they see the potential here they see how
12:09
it can
12:10
uh disintermediate the market to a
12:13
certain extent and help deliver more
12:14
Finance to the carbon project developers
12:17
themselves and through that local
12:19
communities that are on the front lines
12:20
of you know climate impact
12:23
um so that's exciting I think that you
12:25
know they see it as a direct route to
12:28
financing and into the demand side
12:29
participants in the market
12:31
there's others that I think see what
12:34
we're doing is
12:35
a little competition for them now I
12:37
mentioned that the idea of
12:38
disintermediation whenever you do that
12:40
in the market people are going to push
12:42
back because there's middlemen that are
12:43
taking part of the profit right
12:45
um so you know those types of players
12:47
are certainly far less receptive to what
12:49
we're doing
12:51
um
12:52
then you have other there's other groups
12:54
that they associate anything with
12:56
blockchain with like you know scams and
12:59
hacks and it's this wild west right yes
13:02
that's something we have to overcome
13:03
yeah
13:06
excellent and I know I know that
13:09
so are you do you do anything with uh
13:13
with two can protocols I know that you
13:15
were actually you were actually were
13:16
working with that they're kind of
13:17
tooling right if I'm not mistaken
13:20
yeah since you can protocol develop like
13:22
the this first carbon Bridge it's called
13:24
so that basically allows you to digitize
13:26
the offsets that existed in the pair of
13:28
carbon registry
13:30
um so verapaus bridging at first while
13:33
they developed this framework that they
13:35
feel comfortable with but in that time
13:37
like all the major carbon Registries
13:38
have started working groups and figuring
13:40
out how can we do this digitization uh
13:43
we're gonna do it ourselves we're going
13:44
to use a third party those are all
13:46
things that are getting figured out uh
13:48
and there's other carbon bridges that
13:49
are emerged in that team to Mosser and
13:51
C3 Etc there's a few players in it
13:54
excellent excellent so
14:00
if so if an organization this last
14:03
question it
14:05
Asian is looking to enter into this
14:08
space you know what would be the what
14:11
would be the
14:13
implementation path what would be the
14:17
uh uh uh digital transformation Journey
14:21
you think for
14:23
a web 2 company moving in the web three
14:27
yeah so I'll answer that through the
14:29
lens of um like a a carbon project
14:32
developer I think does it provide
14:35
context so you know right now
14:37
um they make partner with different
14:38
organizations that are going to buy
14:40
their credits and then find end buyers
14:43
um the midi forward deals are just about
14:45
deals Etc uh but what this project
14:47
developer can do now is that they can
14:50
directly link into the market and see
14:52
what their types of credits are trading
14:54
at that the pricing is available 24 7
14:56
you know fully transparently on the
14:58
blockchain so they can have a choice of
15:00
let's do selling their credits directly
15:01
in the market after they bring them on
15:03
chain
15:04
um or they could load them into a
15:06
Marketplace uh and you know sell them
15:08
for fixed pricing different participants
15:10
uh they can integrate them into some of
15:12
the other web retooling that does like
15:14
automated offsetting for different
15:16
fintech solutions and such
15:18
um the big thing for them is part of the
15:20
journey is they need to connect the
15:23
carbon registry account with the
15:25
blockchain and that's getting more
15:27
streamlined nowadays
15:29
um again a lot of this is going to get
15:30
abstracted away you're not going to have
15:32
to worry about metamask you're just
15:34
going to have one account
15:36
um you know with the carving registry or
15:38
with another custodian that'll manage
15:40
all that for that
15:43
uh and then it's just going to be like
15:45
they had any other account online you're
15:46
just going to click a few buttons move
15:48
some credits around they're not going to
15:50
worry about any blockchain stuff it
15:51
won't be you know in the background
15:54
yeah yeah and I know I know I said that
15:57
was the last question but I lied so so
16:00
hopefully hopefully this will be the
16:01
last one but so what like what's your
16:03
thoughts in terms of in terms of
16:05
interoperability within within this
16:07
common Finance space
16:09
yeah so this is uh this is an important
16:12
one
16:13
um I spoke to a gentleman from uh pxc so
16:18
they are improved under the uh what is
16:21
it the global blockchain business
16:23
business Council gdbc
16:26
um so they they are looking at what kind
16:28
of working groups they can have here and
16:30
one of them that I'm really pushing for
16:32
is the development of and uh an open
16:35
Digital carbon data standard now what
16:38
does that mean it means that we have the
16:39
data framework in place for how carbon
16:42
offsets are stored on a blockchain it
16:45
also means that we start to standardize
16:46
the processes at the Smart contract
16:48
level on um I don't know if you're like
16:51
carbon retirements that means when you
16:52
actually claim the environmental benefit
16:53
yeah and then that credits taken out of
16:56
the market
16:57
um so all these different processes need
16:59
to be standardized and uh this bxc group
17:02
their infrastructure working groups are
17:04
looking at this and they're you know a
17:06
neutral body
17:07
they're they're working and funded by
17:09
multiple layer one blockchains and uh
17:12
they're also working with the carbon
17:13
Registries themselves so this is
17:14
exciting because of course this types of
17:16
standardization is really important in
17:18
the market if we have you know all the
17:20
Innovation happening across these
17:22
different blockchains and so on being
17:24
able to uh compound let's say right and
17:27
then what's the name of that group again
17:29
uh so it's exe and I'm trying to think
17:32
it's like blockchain climate something
17:35
and then bxci is the blockchain
17:37
infrastructure working group
17:39
um those organizations are underneath
17:43
the global blockchain Business Council
17:46
okay okay
17:50
blockchain Business Council okay
17:56
okay all right perfect yeah so so yeah
17:59
that's pretty much everything everything
18:00
that that I had so do you have kind of
18:03
any any partying words uh where can
18:06
people find you and you know what do you
18:09
what what what what what final
18:12
takeaways or calls to action would you
18:14
have
18:17
sir yeah I would just say um look this
18:20
is a really exciting space I think
18:21
blockchain technology is starting to
18:24
mature
18:25
um the interfaces are getting better uh
18:28
there's just so much Innovation
18:30
happening and I think climate Finance
18:32
itself is also a growing field it's
18:36
tremendously growing good 30X by 2030
18:39
that's just uh carbon offsets and
18:41
voluntary carbon Market uh and so you
18:44
know if you are let's say a developer or
18:47
just someone working client finance and
18:50
you're interested in what's going on
18:51
here check out clean without that
18:53
Finance we have a great resources
18:54
section we've written extensively on all
18:57
the topics that I've talked about in
18:59
this discussion uh and you can also
19:01
follow me on Twitter it's at Drew
19:03
underscore claima I post a lot about you
19:06
know the different developments in this
19:08
space as well as uh Department
19:09
offspending Market more generally and
19:11
yeah be happy to engage in the
19:13
discussion and also if you're a company
19:15
happy to help you source and utilize
19:18
digital carbon assets in the future
19:20
all right excellent Drew thank you for
19:22
your time and until next time


VeChain Foundation Climate Research - Justin Goldston Interviews Nalin Agarwal of Climate Collective

Video Link: https://youtu.be/9cCBNgfyboI

hi everyone uh this is another interview
0:06
for the for the V chain uh academic
0:09
research study on tracking on tracking
0:12
carbon offsets carbon credits and carbon
0:14
Emissions on the blockchain
0:16
um in this in this interview we have we
0:19
have Nolan uh Nolan welcome could you
0:22
introduce yourself and let everyone know
0:24
what you what you do in the space
0:26
sure thanks thanks Justin and thanks for
0:29
having
0:30
having me over on this on this talk
0:33
um so
0:34
um I'm a partner of the climate
0:36
collective in India
0:38
um we're a not-for-profit that runs
0:41
uh climate Tech accelerator programs
0:44
um largely in the South Asian region so
0:47
far so India Sri Lanka Maldives
0:50
um uh in the past as well in Nepal
0:55
um we started off actually as solar and
0:58
wind project developers between 2010 and
1:00
2015 then from 2016 onwards we've grown
1:04
the climate Tech startup ecosystem in
1:06
South Asia through accelerators I now
1:09
oversee a lot of the work we do on the
1:10
capital side so we have fundraising
1:12
platforms we're setting up a VC fund
1:14
um all of that
1:16
um yeah and and and we've supported
1:19
about 860 climate Tech startups so it
1:23
has become the largest platform in South
1:25
Asia this year we're going to expand to
1:27
Southeast Asia as well and next year to
1:30
Africa and the year after two latam so
1:34
we have a global South ambition
1:36
um after having kind of proven the model
1:40
um and supported startups in South Asia
1:42
over the last seven years
1:44
so I'll stop here excellent I appreciate
Challenges faced by Climate Collective
1:47
that so so in terms of in terms of the
1:51
work that you do what
1:54
in terms of the work you do and the
1:56
current techno and current in the
1:58
current technology offerings that you
2:01
that that are in currently in a space
2:03
What are some of the
2:05
shortcomings you know or challenges that
2:08
you've seen
2:11
all right so we work with a wide kind of
2:14
slot uh of domain right so across green
2:18
energy energy optimization uh Mobility
2:22
um carbon Tech uh plastic waste climate
2:26
smart agree and Indus Advanced industry
2:28
right so anything which has a either
2:30
decarbonization Focus or a circle
2:32
economy Focus sorry all adaptation on
2:36
resilience Focus you know
2:38
um all of them are different stages of
2:40
maturity as sectors uh in India right so
2:44
the markets are at different stages of
2:46
development Technologies within them are
2:48
also at different stages of development
2:50
and then so I'm kind of drilling down so
2:52
we have sectoral development we have
2:54
technology development and then we have
2:56
the product level development so
2:58
everyone has their own challenges but
3:00
broadly if you look at
3:03
the general challenges that that uh that
3:06
startups or founders face
3:08
um and just stop me Justin if I'm if I'm
3:11
answering the wrong question but we want
3:13
to understand what startups face as
3:16
challenges right in in you know yeah so
3:20
one yeah so one is of course
3:23
um typically startups in the space have
3:27
longer uh product development cycles and
3:30
also sales Cycles right now product
3:32
development Cycles being a result of
3:35
oftentimes these being sometimes
3:37
Hardware or Hardware plus software so
3:40
digital plus Hardware software so
3:42
there's actually
3:43
um and this is more true for deep Tech
3:45
startups and more and more we are seeing
3:47
deep Tech startups if your business
3:48
model Innovation is different uh but
3:50
that's one
3:51
um
3:52
the other is as I mentioned the sales
3:55
cycle is also longer because many I mean
3:57
the majority of at least the starters we
3:58
see a B2B summer B to G and some are b2c
4:02
but B2B sales cycle in general are
4:05
longer right the other thing for the for
4:08
the sector as a whole
4:10
um
4:11
you know both Founders and investors
4:14
need to have some understanding of
4:17
technology and they need to have some
4:18
domain expertise it's not as simple as
4:20
creating a for example a social an an
4:23
app you know a relatively simple thing
4:26
to do but of course hard to scale but
4:28
you need domain expertise both on the
4:31
founders and the investors so that's a
4:33
general challenge for the ecosystem you
4:35
know but increasingly we're seeing
4:37
higher quality entrepreneurs coming into
4:39
the space we're seeing more specialized
4:41
pools of capital being raised on the
4:43
investment side so that's a positive we
4:45
need much more of it it goes without
4:46
saying uh there's a little a little bit
4:50
much more I mean a little bit
4:53
um as compared to perhaps um uh you know
4:56
some of the other parts of the world
4:57
there's a little bit more scarcity of
5:00
early stage risk Capital so when you're
5:02
starting out non-dilutive Capital that's
5:05
not as as available
5:09
um so that's the other thing that we
5:11
even we are trying to solve uh let's see
5:14
where that goes things are changing so
5:15
we have uh I mean I will say on the
5:19
positive side
5:20
um I think in terms of total startups
5:22
India is today number three in the world
5:24
in terms of climate starters we are
5:26
number nine I guess but if you consider
5:29
Europe as always probably number four
5:32
um so so it's it's green shoots it's
5:35
interesting we're we're managing to
5:37
attract more capital and the right kind
5:38
of entrepreneurs but much more needs to
5:40
be done okay yeah so whenever whenever
Value of increased transparency
5:44
you're looking for
5:45
whenever these startups are looking for
5:47
Investments we spoke briefly about this
5:50
and they're doing pitches you know what
5:54
what value do you see in in the
5:57
increased transparency of the things
6:00
they're doing within the within the
6:02
sustainability space within the climate
6:04
action space within all of these
6:07
different spaces for kind of validation
6:11
yeah yeah I mean that's a good question
6:12
that's I mean that it's kind of the root
6:15
of what uh we do when we do evaluation
6:19
and due diligence right of startups you
6:21
want to know that the claims that a
6:23
startup makes
6:25
um can be validated whether the
6:27
technology claims whether they're
6:29
business claims either of those right so
6:31
what do I mean by that so if there's
6:34
it's a new technology and they say this
6:36
can help improve efficiency by X we need
6:39
to validate that right how do we
6:40
validate that either we go to a third
6:42
party
6:43
um validation service we go to a
6:46
lab that can certify it we go to a
6:50
regulator that can certify it right
6:52
um we go to also customers
6:55
nothing like that right that's the best
6:58
even even before any of this if the
7:00
customers
7:01
tell us that yes this technology has
7:03
helped me save
7:05
money or it's help improve my bottom
7:07
light that's validation right so that's
7:09
something we focus on very strongly is
7:11
customer validation of Market validation
7:13
right
7:15
um something more granular is when we
7:18
evaluate startups we want to make sure
7:19
that the things they're telling us on
7:21
the business side their growth rates
7:23
their yeah whether some Revenue
7:26
profitability
7:28
um right uh I mean I'm sorry or customer
7:32
conversion all of those things that they
7:34
are genuine they're valid right uh and
7:37
this is dynamic data it gets updated all
7:40
the time right you're growing as a
7:42
company so that's the other thing that
7:44
we want is the ability to update data on
7:47
a regular basis right so we need
7:49
transparency and validation of claims
7:53
that the status make we need uh regular
7:56
updation of data and that has to be
7:59
again revalidated right so it's a
8:01
ongoing and dynamic process and imagine
8:03
this happening across
8:05
hundreds and eventually thousands of you
8:07
know complex businesses right so one
8:11
example that we spoke about was the idea
8:13
of creating this data sharing platform
8:15
where for example startup needs to apply
8:18
for Grants it needs to apply for uh
8:21
investment as Equity or it needs to
8:24
apply for debt Capital to a bank
8:27
uh or any supplied with an accelerator
8:29
or it needs to for example do a sales
8:33
pitch
8:34
um get in panel by a corporate for
8:35
example right all of this requires them
8:38
to share data about their business about
8:40
the technology uh share information on
8:43
cost benefit analysis they've done or
8:45
the customer value property all of this
8:46
and oftentimes this is a repeated game
8:48
you know
8:50
um because
8:51
um yeah sorry
8:53
has been done over and over again right
8:55
uh it's almost like the administrative
8:58
part of anyone's job that no one likes
8:59
to do you know if you can automate some
9:01
of that then we have the world has
9:03
automated a lot of this in the last
9:04
decade you know but it hasn't happened
9:07
so much in the startup space so we're
9:09
trying to
9:10
we're trying to build a data sharing
9:12
platform that allows startups to create
9:13
a blog profile and then start to apply
9:16
through that almost like what LinkedIn
9:18
does for recruitment you know
9:21
um so that's a good analogy
9:23
um and that's that's something that
9:26
would benefit by increased transparency
9:29
and and to some extent also in yeah the
9:33
the inability to fudge you know uh
9:39
uh yeah numbers and data so I think
9:42
that's uh that's one uh yeah I hope kind
9:46
of this this is one use case that I can
9:48
think of yeah yeah because yeah you
Oracles
9:50
brought up you brought up three
9:52
different things that I kind of want to
9:53
go down so so whenever you say that you
9:57
have third party validation and
9:58
validation of regulators within the
10:01
blockchain space we have something
10:02
referred to as oracles so oracles are
10:06
essentially pretty much third okay so
10:07
you're familiar with oracles
10:11
I mean in The Matrix context or
10:13
something else so within within
10:15
blockchain they have oracles where you
10:17
have you can actually you can actually
10:19
take off chain data and validate it and
10:22
bring it on chain so you can have a
10:24
third party that goes in and actually
10:26
validates validates certain things now
10:29
if you if you were to have if you so I'm
10:32
asking do you think that you could have
10:35
a group of these third-party validators
10:37
to come in and be oracles and to kind of
10:40
be incentivized to validate the data on
10:44
chain or certain organizations let's
10:46
just say hypothetically these
10:48
organizations were putting this
10:50
information on chain you know we're
10:51
trying to get funding and then you have
10:53
oracles that are coming from the from a
10:56
third party like a group and they're
10:58
incentivized to say okay we'll give you
11:00
uh five thousand dollars to go and
11:02
validate this for this 10 million dollar
11:04
deal right sure do you think that's do
11:07
you think that's going to be that would
11:08
be like feasible
11:12
um
11:13
I mean off of the bad I think so it's
11:16
the same I mean just to understand just
11:17
to get my mental framework right it's
11:20
similar work what you're doing off chain
11:22
the difference is you're doing it on
11:23
chain correct validation
11:26
yeah so yeah the information there's no
11:29
it's like let's just say hypothetically
11:30
we have we have we're doing uh uh
11:34
uh carbon offset a carbon offset
11:37
tracking you know uh Solution on chain
11:40
right a refi a refile platform on chain
11:42
right with a pitch right and they're
11:46
pitching and they're going in and
11:48
they're and they're validating you know
11:50
with a third party
11:52
whether or not their their claims are
11:55
indeed accurate
11:56
but some of that that is off chain for
11:58
example
12:00
right right so those third-party
12:02
validators actually go on would go on
12:04
chain and say yes this information is
12:07
indeed valid and this the startups
12:09
claiming yeah yeah yeah
12:10
got it no I think it yeah I mean I don't
12:13
see why
12:15
um it wouldn't it couldn't happen so
12:17
okay yeah I think it's maybe a
12:20
transition period where people get used
12:22
to the idea of it but this is big
12:24
business as you know validation and
12:26
certification right so if if the same
12:30
business continues on chain as more
12:33
streamlined it offers greater
12:35
transparency
12:37
um right yeah I think so okay and then
Crowdfunding
12:41
another thing another thing we're
12:42
talking about because because this whole
12:44
this whole funding thing is is very
12:46
interesting you know because you know
12:48
you see and this comes from my previous
12:50
experience where you have these social
12:52
impact investors and their social impact
12:55
investors they're still they're still
12:57
looking they're still looking for
12:58
they're still looking for a return on
12:59
investment right so yeah so have you
13:02
seen do you do you have because there
13:05
are some there are some tools uh in in
13:07
different countries uh where you can
13:09
actually do crowdfunding type type type
13:12
options right do you see do you one do
13:17
you do you deal with any kind of
13:19
crowdfunding type type Solutions within
13:22
this space and do you see that if you
13:24
see that type of option growing within
13:26
within this social impact area yeah yeah
13:29
yeah no absolutely in fact this is a
13:32
this is an area of great interest class
13:35
uh we have a platform ourselves where we
13:38
pull in capital from what we call what
13:39
we call retail investors right so these
13:42
are
13:43
um typically salary people they could be
13:46
Angels Etc who invest much more they're
13:48
also interested in investing small
13:50
amounts so the equivalent of let's say
13:52
uh four thousand us up to 10 000 us
13:56
12 000 us yeah so they put in these kind
14:00
of check sizes we pull that capital in a
14:03
in a alternative investment fund vehicle
14:07
um and then deploy onwards so there's
14:09
only one entry on the cap table it's not
14:11
like if for 40 people come into the it's
14:14
very difficult for startups by the way
14:15
if 40 people who crowdfund come onto the
14:18
cap table at least this is the situation
14:20
in India right because and I'm sure it's
14:22
the same in most places because the
14:23
reason is later stage funders and later
14:26
stage investors don't like too many
14:27
people on the cap table right the
14:28
capitalization table of this data it's
14:31
better to use a pooling vehicle and
14:33
that's what we are doing we're using
14:34
pooling vehicle getting funds from the
14:37
crowd of course you still have to meet
14:38
certain you know criteria of being an
14:42
eligible investor
14:44
um and then deploying right so yeah I'm
14:46
aware that this can be done through the
14:48
blockchain uh I'm not aware whether the
14:51
regulatory framework is that amenable
14:53
uh using uh you know daos
14:58
um or blockchain based cryptos as a way
15:01
to to raise money off because then you
15:03
know
15:04
the markets regulator will step in if
15:06
and you know uh so I know what's
15:10
happening for example and it may happen
15:12
uh also there's some jurisdiction which
15:15
do allow pooling enough Capital like
15:17
this using the blockchain and once it's
15:19
pooled then it can kind of flow into
15:23
another country because then it's coming
15:25
from let's say a private limited or LLP
15:27
or something you know so that's that is
15:29
that's that's possible
15:31
um but in India to to kind of summarize
15:33
yes crowdfunding
15:35
[Music]
15:37
um does happen we pull into a you know
15:39
specialized vehicle and deploy into
15:41
startups
15:42
okay not so easy on the blockchain yet
15:45
excellent so I know I know we we you
Regenerative Finance
15:49
know I actually brought up the I
15:51
actually brought up the the concept of
15:53
refi regenerative finance and you said
15:55
that you were you were familiar with
15:57
that you know can you show your can you
15:59
share your thoughts on that and and and
16:01
talk about whether or not do you think
16:04
it it has any legs in the future
16:08
yeah I mean again it's not something
16:10
that I have um you know that I've delved
16:14
into too deeply
16:16
um uh however I do believe that this is
16:19
this is an interesting
16:22
um
16:23
kind of financial mechanism especially
16:25
for what we call nature-based projects
16:27
right so for this A4 station right uh or
16:31
it's regenerative agriculture right
16:34
um so
16:35
um these I mean of course it's being
16:37
used for several things and and I I do
16:39
know that for example
16:41
D5 is also used with nfts but
16:44
specifically sorry
16:47
um refi I do believe that NBS I mean
16:49
what we call nature-based Solutions
16:51
that's the that's the kind of low
16:52
hanging fruit here
16:54
um
16:56
again this is not something that we have
16:59
uh seen
17:01
um too many use cases or examples of in
17:03
India uh we're exploring it with some
17:06
um people um who who kind of uh leading
17:10
the effort in the space in India but
17:13
um yeah uh that's that's my limited
17:16
understanding of this we we're currently
17:18
very much from the traditional Finance
17:20
space we go to ilps hnis and and family
17:24
offices and all of that you know
17:27
excellent excellent so so whenever you
Family Offices
17:30
whenever you're talking about so
17:32
in terms of family offices this is this
17:36
is an interesting topic too so when
17:37
you're talking about family offices do
17:39
you see a lot of family offices trying
17:41
to get in trying to enter into this
17:43
into this space or you're trying or is
17:46
it more of like an education piece and
17:48
then you're trying to knock them into
17:50
getting into this space like which which
17:52
way which way is it
17:53
yeah yeah that's a good question uh and
17:56
then you said this space you had normal
17:57
climate right not the blockchain space
17:59
right climate land right yeah yeah okay
18:01
good
18:02
um so mixed bag right uh there's like in
18:08
everything you have you have the
18:09
progressive guys you have the early
18:11
adopters you're the progressive guys
18:13
um by and large there's a huge interest
18:15
in climate that that that's something I
18:18
can say pretty categorically right now
18:20
whether people are actually putting
18:22
money on the table that's that's why I
18:25
say it's a mixed bag right but everyone
18:27
is interested so we work with family
18:29
offices in in
18:30
in a number of ways exactly what you
18:33
said so one is on the awareness building
18:34
second is on education and the third is
18:37
on the actual fundraising you know so
18:40
depending on which kind of stage they
18:42
are in the learning curve and and in the
18:45
risk appetite
18:46
um especially because at least in our
18:48
case we are we are playing in the early
18:50
early stage uh you know pre-series a uh
18:54
stage right so some family officers who
18:57
do play in the same stage
19:00
um are looking at
19:01
um climate seriously
19:03
um in fact for the first fundry I think
19:05
most of uh yeah most of our LPS will be
19:08
Indian domestic family offices and hnis
19:11
you know so there's sufficient interest
19:13
here
19:15
um and sufficient capital I think and
19:17
keep in mind Justin that there's a
19:20
like in the U.S and in the EU there's a
19:23
similar kind of intergenerational wealth
19:24
transfer happening right the younger
19:26
generation is oftentimes kind of more
19:28
aligned
19:30
um you know perhaps I don't want to use
19:33
that word but let me anyway but like
19:34
values and profit right of course the
19:37
the good business stewards but
19:40
um they want to make sure that they're
19:42
doing the the right things and
19:43
oftentimes these guys like uh the
19:46
environment as a sector you know and
19:48
climate all squarely in that so yeah
19:51
mixed bag definite interest all around
19:54
some people already uh acting some
19:58
people are waiting and watching but yeah
20:00
most most people we speak to say no no
20:03
one says no short answer okay all right
20:07
so
Regulation in India
20:08
so because I I know I know the United I
20:11
know the US the US is putting more
20:13
regulation in terms of uh adding adding
20:17
transparency for public companies when
20:20
it comes to climate so I haven't really
20:22
because that just happened last March so
20:25
I did not I haven't done any research in
20:27
terms of India so my question is you
20:30
know what type of Regulation is is
20:33
happening is happening in India where
20:35
they're kind of requiring organizations
20:37
to to make their make their data and you
20:41
know their greenhouse gas emissions just
20:43
like that making that transparent to
20:46
investors public no no no that's a good
20:49
question
20:50
um so we have something that's the
20:53
market regulator is called uh uh setting
20:57
the security and security is an exchange
20:59
Board of India they've introduced
21:02
um
21:03
um the business responsibility and
21:05
sustainable reporting framework right
21:07
and that is India's ESG uh reporting
21:10
framework ESG auditing and rating
21:13
framework for listed companies right
21:16
um
21:17
now very recently in fact uh I was
21:20
reading I think uh it's Feb so yeah
21:23
maybe end of November something is when
21:26
there was news that they were they were
21:28
planning to simplify uh it because you
21:30
know I mean I think so this is sometimes
21:32
a challenge with eag is that reporting
21:35
is not that simple but to put in
21:36
baselining
21:39
um methodologies and data collection and
21:41
all of that and sometimes that becomes
21:42
its own Beast so I think it's a good
21:45
step but yeah I mean to to kind of uh
21:49
um share the brsr is our PhD reporting
21:53
framework all listed companies need to
21:55
comply
21:57
um the second thing is uh I think we
22:00
were doing this research there's about
22:02
139 Indian corporates and this is this
22:06
could be by the way dated because this
22:07
is four months ago I did this research
22:09
so about 139 corporates Indian
22:12
corporates have signed up to some public
22:16
commitment to decarbonize right perhaps
22:19
the CDP has BT ev100 re100 any one of
22:23
these right so that's also a nice kind
22:26
of critical threshold of largely listed
22:29
companies and perhaps a few unlisted
22:31
that are made public pledges you know
22:34
um uh yeah so this is happening we have
22:37
the Indian railways which is the largest
22:38
employer of people in the world
22:40
um that's made a net zero pledge by
22:43
2013. so there are things which are
22:46
happening on the net zero side on the
22:49
ESG reporting and auditing side
22:52
um which are linked of course and on on
22:54
the carbonization in general and
22:55
decarbonization across scope one two and
22:58
three scope three is the hardest and we
23:00
are doing for example just to share
23:02
we're doing a program which we call
23:04
climate challenges that's working with
23:06
you know a subset of these large 139
23:08
corporates and the idea is to start
23:10
working with them send signals over time
23:13
to throw the supply chain right
23:17
um and a lot of the supply chain of
23:19
course as you know is is comprised of uh
23:21
like smes small and medium Enterprises
23:24
okay
23:26
um so that sends signals over time I
23:28
mean this is a medium to long-term goal
23:30
but you know
23:32
um these signals are powerful enough for
23:34
hopefully that'll lead to SME
23:36
decarbonization as well okay okay
23:39
excellent excellent yeah this this
23:42
conversation was very very very
23:44
interesting I have a lot of notes that I
23:47
need to that I need that I need to
23:49
follow up on a lot of things that I
23:50
didn't I didn't know about so that's the
23:52
that's the power of this it's the That's
23:54
The Power of this of this technology
23:55
this technology where we just hop hop on
23:58
a zoom call and and just zoom in and
24:00
share our thoughts so thank you for your
24:03
time and
24:05
um
24:06
well again until next time
24:09
awesome thank you Justin

VeChain Foundation Climate Research - Justin Goldston Interviews Andi Stanner of Toucan Protocol

Video Link:  https://youtu.be/bERCJtmv_AA

hi everyone Dr Justin Golston here coming to you with another interview
0:07
this time we are we are speaking with Andy from toucan protocol one of my
0:12
favorite protocols uh welcome Andy can you tell us a little bit about yourself
0:17
hey everyone this is Andy from from tucum protocol as you introduced me
0:23
um I'm product leaders who can protocol so I'm looking into and after everything
0:29
and anything around meta Registries um so basically the way of tracking
0:35
carbon across its life cycle and also uh around all the product aspects that we
0:41
have to bring car on chain which is what we call Bridges um that's basically tokenizing assets
0:48
um namely carbon credits at this point in time and bringing it into the meta
0:54
registry um and then later handing it over to our other departments that are looking into
1:01
giving carbon credits more utility on chain which is financial products uh
1:06
commodification and um you know utility beyond the
1:12
retirement of carbon um because that is our hypothesis that with more of these uh utility aspects
1:21
around carbon tokens which is unique to the blockchain and
1:27
web3 and what web3 can do with carbon um our hypothesis is that this is
1:32
basically What's um uh you know what will be driving a huge wave of Demands and what will
1:39
become a a sink for carbon credits which ultimately obviously creates demand for
1:46
new projects and new mitigation action and this is all what we want to do
1:51
excellent thanks thanks for that so so you know in my into my initial research
1:56
within within this space you know going back a while back you know this whole meta registry you know topic came up can
2:04
you can you define that for for non-natives because I think that would be that would be good
2:09
yeah so today what we have is we have a bunch of Registries um and standard programs normally it
2:16
goes like this every standard program so basically a a group of well scientists
2:22
or experts would Define what is a good carbon Credit Union project
2:27
um and who also um do the QA or basically Define the guardrails for the QA
2:33
um into this they also run a registry system a ledger of
2:39
um of carbon credits so basically when they be when are they being issued who
2:45
are they being issued to who are they being transferred to and who are they being retired by
2:51
um and with what kind of additional metadata and information um all of these transactions happen
2:58
um so one of the things that we have obviously from from this aspect is that
3:04
we when we do all of this in silos and what we're trying to do uh tackle a global project uh and a global problem
3:13
um with many many projects um we have we get really quickly into uh
3:19
interoperability issues and into things like double counting meaning like you count the same emission reduction or
3:26
emission uh if you will uh you counted twice um or you spend it twice which would be
3:33
double use um because um you have uh systems that don't talk
3:39
to each other for example or you have the same projects in two systems um or you move one project to from one
3:45
system to another and you lose a lot of data in between so um this is a big issue on a
3:53
intergovernmental level but this is also a big issue on the private sector level which is the voluntary carbon Market
4:00
because none of these um crediting standards are
4:06
um you know have an oversight overseeing body that is uh regulating all of that
4:12
we do that in in the vcm so the voluntary carbon Market uh you know in a
4:18
self-regulatory um and pseudoregulatory way and yet we
4:24
still our systems are still not connected to each other so we have a lot of friction there we lose transparency
4:29
along the way um it's very costly to them retroactively establish transparency so
4:36
looking in doing due diligence doing um audits on where something moved from or
4:43
is this the only registry that has this project for example um can I safely spend the credits uh and
4:51
can I rest assured for that so we spend a lot of money and time on that so um an ideal scenario is of course a a
4:58
tooling that would combine all of these and and that would build privilege between these these silos and
5:04
um what better infrastructure has there ever been than a A system that can be
5:11
run completely trustless and doesn't require any private entity any
5:17
administrator any anyone who could do human error or could go wrong or could
5:23
go out of business and lose all records um what better system did we ever have
5:29
then at this point in time um where we have public blockchains who
5:35
um or which can take all of this information and are practically built for this because every transaction has
5:41
embedded value into it so and that is exactly what uh transacting carbon
5:46
credits is you transact value and um so these systems are made for it and
5:52
our purpose uh as a meta registry is that we provide a way of
5:58
um having us a a a ledger system that is can
6:04
and can serve all these purposes that normally a centralized entity would do which is if we combine all of this we
6:11
keep track at one at one place basically conceptually in one place but with all
6:17
the benefits of a decentralized uh um system which is we if we go out of
6:23
business it doesn't matter right so uh we have no way of spending or erasing
6:29
the uh erasing the history of a credit or spending a credit credit twice or
6:34
help anyone or no matter how many trillions of dollars you put onto this Ledger we cannot uh it's it's the safest
6:41
it can get at this point and that is why we believe um and increasingly many thankfully do
6:49
so that we need a registry of Registries basically so a meta right it's really
6:56
um where uh carbon assets can be tracked can we
7:01
um can live basically uh through all of their life cycle
7:07
excellent so so with this so yeah you mentioned you mentioned a you mentioned a number of uh or a few challenges you
7:16
know outside of the challenges that you already mentioned what other challenges do you see with with this with this type
7:21
of of climate Finance adoption within this space you know from the from the
7:27
current web through space and then in order to get these traditional web 2
7:33
companies to come over to web3 and try and try to utilize this this tool
7:39
I think the one of the main the main friction points here is the
7:47
um you know guilt by affiliation um in a sense that there's a lot of
7:53
prejudice against what web3 is and what's happening inside of web3 and
7:58
there's a lot of focus on on like a very my minor fraction of uh of the actual
8:06
energy that's being put into this in in a sense of uh that is a that is actual
8:11
scams or um there is actually a net negative for
8:17
um for the planet and um it's being portrayed onto uh onto a
8:23
system that is trying to solve something completely different with what is a perfectly neutral infrastructure and
8:30
perfectly neutral technology and um I think there's a lot of you know educational effort to be made and also
8:37
regulatory polarity to be given um so that people are and by people I
8:43
mean uh companies mostly um are not afraid of
8:49
um that this is uh you know the devil that they should not be touching um with the stick it's uh it's an it's a
8:57
technology and um ideally and I think that's something that we as we need to need to nail much
9:04
better than we currently do um ideally we understand that all of this is running under the hood and we
9:10
need to portray it in a way and we need to also enable ux in a way that it looks like
9:15
you don't even know that it's it's all of this is running a blockchain you don't have to care you can operate as
9:22
you operate it always um we know we've just at a lower cost level on at a higher frequency and at a
9:31
um at a easier auditability so your auditor will be very happy with that but
9:36
um you as an investor in a kind of mitigation project you might not even have to care and you should not care and
9:43
I think that is where we need to go and there's many many cool projects that uh
9:48
that that try these and building on-rams and off-ramps and uh automation Etc so
9:54
so that people don't even have to interact with anything that feels like web3 or feels complicated or setting up
10:01
metamask Wallace and stuff like that um and but we're still early we're still
10:07
you know on the going west trip currently so uh where uh we're the early
10:14
pioneers and and we're learning every day on how to make it you know more acceptable for the for the broader
10:19
masses and we also need a little bit of you know reaching out your hand from the broader masses or from the
10:25
representative of that which is Regulators maybe and um and in all of that that handshake
10:32
will inevitably happen um and we all will prosper from that a
10:38
lot but I think it will be happening quicker the less you know Prejudice we
10:43
have in between and the less fat that is in between um so any kind of educational material
10:49
such as this um is super highly welcome and I think it's super important uh in the in the
10:56
adoption yeah yeah that's one thing that Drew said that that's that's important as
11:02
well Drew from from uh from clementow you know he said he they're they're working with a number of organizations
11:08
on to build the tooling too so they don't they don't even know it's blockchain right so also another thing
11:15
is they're actually doing a lot of Education within within the industry so are you do you all find you all doing
11:21
education or is it mostly the community that's educating people on what toucan does how is that working within your
11:27
ecosystem it's both it's um
11:32
it's people who have the who hold the customer relationships because we don't sell credits or produce them or
11:39
um ideally interact with them uh on the you know outskirts of the or on the extreme points of the life cycle but
11:46
there's you know marketplaces and intermediaries and um you know consultants for project
11:52
developers or project developers themselves who educate other project developers so
11:58
um we we rely on those of course and it's the only scalable value of doing
12:03
that but at the same time we do know that we have an educational
12:09
um you know a a a a task a quest of doing that and um so we do that we
12:16
create lots of content um on on different aspects we try to join every working groups
12:24
um of the um you know from the conventional Market in order to
12:29
um to educate players that are sitting at these extreme points for example standard bodies so we spend a lot of
12:35
energy and a lot of time for example on on formulating
12:41
what we think is important input for their consultation pieces so the last
12:46
summer will be going down in my history in my memory as the as the consultation summer because practically every every
12:54
standard body um issued their own consultations with overlapping but also specific questions
13:01
to their situation and we try to answer all of them and we try to be as collaborative as possible and and you
13:07
know work and extend the hands um and even you know uh bend a little
13:13
bit from away from our way what we want to do uh in ways that are more easily to
13:19
understand or easily need to grasp for for uh for the incumbent players
13:25
um so in order to make this more you know to create a pathway with how
13:31
information can flow because I think one of the worst thing that anyone and everyone in the space can do on either
13:38
side um and I even hate the idea of this sites about this but if you think about
13:43
web 2 and web 3 the best thing we can do is being elitist and that is either being like
13:49
hey we have always done it like that and who the are you guys and on the
13:54
same way the other way around like Hey we're a web 3 like uh we are uh the old
14:00
ways are all dumb and all corrupt and it's all run by Banks and it's not working
14:06
um none of this is is helpful so um I think the best thing we can all do is doing
14:13
what we all do best um so if you're good at content you create content we have a bunch of people
14:19
also internally of took into can do do that and we create a lot of those of those contents we collaborate and I
14:26
would ask the community and I always do um to uh you know to to do their
14:34
missionary purpose on this as well and um I think it's we're making we're
14:41
making Headway with this it's uh it's being from a standpoint where we had
14:47
a standoff really between uh players we're getting much closer
14:53
um with with everyone involved both the demand and the supply side with intermediaries and with standarding
14:59
programs and with Lobby groups and with interest groups Etc um all of them are you know trying to
15:06
understand each other better and all of them are trying to educate each other so um that's really good
15:13
excellent excellent so whenever so given
15:18
that you know the what your your particular model what what what protocols are you currently on and then
15:25
and and you're in your opinion how important is the interoperability between different different protocols
15:32
and different ecosystems for this type of solution yeah I'm trying how this how this meta
15:39
registry works from a interoperability perspective like is that like a roll-up
15:44
like how does that work all right so question number one what's
15:52
the networks we're currently on so we are on polygon and cello um and are looking out for other
15:59
um for other chains as well so we believe that uh um the protocol should be on all chains
16:07
um or basically on all chains that are um interested or and also interesting in
16:12
sense of an ecosystem that can benefit from that so there's no point in in being on chains and 0.4 chains that uh
16:21
they have uh you know a utility like a carbon crediting uh or a carbon credit
16:27
registry and and bridges to carbon crediting systems if there is no
16:33
um no one using that so one one of the things that is important to us is that there's a an ecosystem a thriving
16:39
ecosystem of um uh demand and and where this can
16:45
where these kind of assets can create utility for people being it um for uh you know Financial Primitives
16:53
um and the the what's called refi use cases um but it's also uh in in a sense where
17:00
um where people for example have Exposition and and are very well on the
17:05
way in this um you know uh building a bridge to the to the and I
17:14
know that I'm stressing this metaphor a lot today um we're basically building a bridge to
17:19
uh to the web 2 sphere of things um and where corporates for example feel at
17:25
home uh I think this is also a very valuable um very valuable place to be and
17:32
um so what do we think about interoperability we think it's key um for this because we also don't think
17:38
that there's one ecosystem to rule them all um much like there's not one standarding
17:43
program to rule them all much like there's not one methodology to rule them all much like there's not you know
17:49
Carbon removal will take care of everything it's it's a you know portfolio of solutions like we have a
17:56
portfolio of problems we're trying to solve here so we need to have a portfolio of solutions
18:02
um and for that interoperability is one piece and um so because it's unlocking just
18:07
different ecosystems investigates the hypothesis here and so how does it work
18:13
as a matter of History a meta registry needs to function meta so aggregating in a form for
18:22
different input factors like standard programs but it also needs to be meta in a form of it needs to be valid on on
18:30
different chains and different ecosystems and the whole idea of if you remember in the beginning I said
18:36
stuff about not you know double used credits or uh not double count things
18:41
this has this has to be true and has to be proliferated uh into this uh you know
18:47
task of inter creating interoperability because it would be it would be a a
18:54
horrible scenario if you go from one chain to another chain and you you
18:59
basically you double the carbon credits there and or you spend the carbon credit and you don't track it in in this and
19:05
you you enable double spend so that is one very very crucial aspect that needs
19:10
to be taken care of and um that is taken care of uh every time
19:15
that we go uh to another chain um that we that we make sure that
19:22
um value can flow between systems but can say will stay unique
19:28
um and that there's only basically one carbon credit what in a token reflecting
19:34
one ton sequestered from uh from the atmosphere at any given time
19:39
um and not several ones excellent so
19:46
so you mentioned you mentioned the whole refi thing I think we mentioned it a few times already so in your definition is
19:53
it is it is it refi or is it is it common Finance you know because
20:00
in your words I think refi to me is conceptually
20:07
baking climate Finance into Finance so baking climate mitigation and and
20:14
enabling the Regeneration of the planet by baking it as a financial as Financial
20:21
Primitives into how we do business how we transact value today and
20:28
um so ideally the outcome the ultimate outcome of of refi is that every time you transact one currency of value you
20:36
heal the planet a little bit and now there's a bunch of things how you could do that and carbon markets play a core
20:43
role in this because they are the most advanced most the biggest tool that we came up as a as humans today
20:51
um while that was employing the power of markets Into Climate finance and not
20:59
make it a philanthropic thing or a we rely on governments only thing
21:04
um because we saw that this is going nowhere fast enough and
21:09
um that it's just taking too much time and politics are getting in the way of survival here
21:15
um so we could there was created a a private system and the concept like I
21:22
said the concept of refi is to take the system and fuel it with what we do
21:27
anyway by transacting money by wanting to make profit by wanting to grow by
21:33
creating utility by creating Financial Freedom for example and what better way would that be banking the unbanked
21:40
creating Financial Freedom for the rest of the world for people who don't have it yet and at the same time hook
21:46
everyone up to this other system that is basically empowering Revenue generation
21:53
so yeah it is climate Finance but it's I think it's it's power in climate Finance
22:00
um by again it's it's that the theme is recurring putting it under the hood
22:06
ideally you don't know about that you don't know that you participate in refi you don't you don't think about that you
22:12
come and you want to borrow money great go to this place where you can uh you know borrow against uh you know you
22:19
can hold a carbon asset for example and borrow against that why why not that rather than holding cash why not Finance
22:27
so I'm at mitigation first basically and uh hold an appreciating asset and borrow
22:32
against that so this is you know an example of how you bake you find how you
22:39
take climate finance and put it into Financial Primitives that we all use and
22:45
need to use and want to use every day so so given these because I'm on board
22:53
with you I love what what you all are doing but you know based on what you see based on the conversations that you have
22:59
in the industry how how how how far how far out are we into into Mass adoption
23:06
for this you know in your in your in your opinion
23:11
I think we are um we're not we're not as far away comparatively as
23:20
the blockchain space itself so um it's it's a little bit of a conundrum
23:26
so it's younger than than web3 in in total it's younger than decentralized
23:32
Finance um but it's less dependent on
23:37
um on recreating financial flow and you know unbanking banks for example or uh
23:45
on on stuff like that we are much closer and it's much easier for us to adopt
23:52
because we are we are replacing a system that needed to be or needs to be and
23:59
wants to be also replaced and people are not fine like many parts of the market are not fighting back against this I'm
24:06
not fighting back against technology uh that the blockchain technology in CD tremendous value that especially around
24:13
transparency and immutability and you know no human error can take place in
24:19
this uh what needs to be a a high scale always available and and high security
24:27
level system there's a lot of trust into that already from from Market sites so
24:32
the adoption part um that we need to have and the mass adoption part I think is is something
24:40
that is via what you also discussed before
24:45
um and and withdrew from from Team model and what I mentioned earlier also via
24:51
the the idea of um you know putting all of this under the hood and having
24:56
um having a usability layer on top of that that takes care of fears and and
25:03
complexity and Etc I think it's easier for us to do that in the climate space
25:08
and in the in the um climate Finance space than to do that for example in
25:17
um Mass financing products and uh you know replacing banks for your everydays
25:25
persons saving a checkings account or how you want to get your salary uh being
25:31
paid in crypto or whatever some stuff like this I think this is much more complex and complicated and has many
25:38
more barriers than where we are currently operating which is why all of
25:43
this is and it's often called the killer use case which is a bit uh
25:51
um you know maybe poor wording but uh it's it's a fantastic use case for for
25:56
blockchain because the value is intrinsic it's we don't have to come up with currencies and tell you that you
26:03
need to trust me that there's definitely value in my protocol you can see it it's it's there you understand it because
26:09
people pay for the asset already and at the same time there is
26:15
[Music] um a little bit of an educational effort to be done but I think there can be a huge
26:23
unlock for example when um major players in the industry for
26:28
example standard bodies start officially endorsing this or when major when major demand side players unlock uh you know
26:37
unlock the gates by buying into this and trusting this I think
26:44
um that will have a ripple effect and uh that that will be tremendous and it will
26:50
be easier because the market itself currently it's a two billion dollar market uh vcm so it's very easy to uh
26:57
like comparatively easy to to bring that on chain for example
27:03
um and requires not that much Capital as other markets would for example require if you want to bring the whole uh real
27:12
estate space onto blockchains that would be a much bigger Endeavor so um
27:17
I think we are at a point where many interesting things come together Market
27:22
is still small sadly but that's the truth uh ECM is still too small we need to grow it but we are in a place where
27:30
this means we can um we can we have people and and we have counterparts that
27:37
are very that are centralized enough to uh um talk to them in in a custom fashion
27:44
and con uh convey the story uh uniquely so that people can understand it and so
27:50
that we can take fears as everyone has them and we can address them individually so we don't have to run
27:56
around with for you know with us with thousands of companies on and or thousands of standard bodies of
28:02
thousands of uh of of centers or hundreds of regional governments or something like this there's only a few
28:09
for us um comparatively to condense and um so I think that plus the intrinsic
28:16
value of uh of web 3 for this is is an awesome um
28:22
Singularity that we should capitalize on and I think one of the big barriers
28:28
that's still in between all of that is like I said the the missing educational
28:34
piece or the in you know in conjunction with that the fear
28:39
um around what could all go wrong um but yeah I think that's something to
28:45
me it seems like this is this is a problem that's that can be tackled yeah and you say you say something you
28:52
said something that I hadn't even thought of yet where with this you're actually solving a true a true real life
28:59
problem where in the past in a lot of use cases in blockchain we were creating
29:05
Solutions yes the solutions work but we really weren't solving the problem right so if we can educate if we can
29:13
educate the people that yes we are solving a real world problem then I think that you know that's one thing
29:19
that that's one way that we can get people in and also what's very interesting where where you point out
29:24
that it's going to be easy to bring a whole entire you know sector on chain right you know I think I think it'd be
29:30
impossible to bring a real estate industry on chain in my opinion but but like you said it's so centralized it's
29:36
so small uh that you can bring it on chain that's another that's another interesting interesting concept that you
29:42
can bring to the industry to these to these standard standard standarding standardized bodies where you know I
29:48
think you're going to get you're going to get this web to adoption uh within within this space so so that's that's pretty much all I
29:56
had oh we went we went a little long so so I apologize for that but how can how can people find you and do you have any
30:03
any calls to action for people who view this absolutely
30:08
um so you can find us on Twitter um you find every all of our socials
30:14
there and information uh I think we're on every social channel uh that's that's
30:20
uh you you most likely want to be on also um and you will find us there are also
30:26
as token protocol um join our Discord um we do have uh
30:33
um a very nice Discord uh uh conversation going on
30:38
um and you can ask any questions there reach out to us on any of the socials
30:44
and uh you can you can it leads to getting interviews the next day uh if
30:51
you if you do that so um uh we're we're all there to to answer
30:57
any questions and my call to action um is that get familiar with all of this
31:03
like if you are um if you are a web two person working
31:09
in the space interested in that read up on this ask questions where like the whole Community is super like it's a
31:16
it's a game changer if you change from a web to uh you know ecosystem into a web
31:22
3 ecosystem and you see how helpful people are how there's no dumb questions
31:28
um how anything and everything you want to ask can be asked and will be answered um sometimes with memes but in 90 of the
31:35
times you will uh you will get a proper answer um and uh go about this there's no fear
31:43
um you don't have to have any fear uh about this and um reach out and my call to reaction to
31:50
any web free crowd watching or or or um that has been uh that that you know
31:58
is being involved in this is we don't want to be in any kind of elitists like we we need some uh we need some humble
32:06
that has been a market that has been built for decades um and it's working no matter what we
32:12
think about it it's working it's creating mitigation action and
32:17
um I think we all of us that our purpose is to not increase the Divide but
32:23
actually take it away um and for that I think we we need to
32:29
respect and meet people where where they are meant to be and help them make the
32:35
transition to what we all know already is the generational technology it's our
32:40
internet basically our internet moment and uh um there's no you know nothing to be
32:47
ashamed of but also nothing to be elitist or proud of uh in a sense that
32:52
this is all for us all together Andy thank you thank you for your time
32:58
thank you for your time I really appreciate it and you gave us you gave you gave you gave me a lot to a lot to
33:05
uh further research further and uh best of luck to you and and toucan
33:12
thank you very much all right thanks see everyone

VeChain Foundation Climate Research with Justin Goldston and Alison Filler of Climate Collective

Video Link: https://youtu.be/sYGk1KpS9cQ

hi everyone and welcome to the next
0:05
installment of the V chain carbon
0:08
emissions carbon credit research uh
0:11
today I have Allison from carbon
0:13
Collective Allison can you introduce
0:15
yourself Larry everyone know what you do
0:17
hey everyone my name is Allison thanks
0:20
Justin I'm with climate Collective we
0:22
are an innovation Network that is
0:25
supporting entrepreneurs scientists
0:28
non-profits investors
0:30
um to build out and apply new digital
0:33
Technologies to unlock climate action at
0:35
scale so glad to be with you today
0:38
yes thank you for that so so I've been
0:42
I've been speaking with uh a lot a
0:44
number of people on this on this topic
0:46
uh I've been having some
0:49
various opinions
0:51
on on tracking on tracking carbon
0:53
emissions carbon emissions and carbon
0:56
credits on the blockchain you know
0:57
what's your what's your thoughts on that
0:59
and you know what do you think the
1:01
future holds on that topic
1:04
yeah well I think we have a lot of
1:05
opportunities right now we don't have
1:08
too many proven use cases yet but we
1:10
have a lot of opportunity to explore
1:12
um and some of the benefits that we're
1:14
looking forward to with tracking Carbon
1:16
on chain are primarily in terms of
1:17
transparency and auditability so
1:21
to understand why this is useful at all
1:24
we have to go back to what are the
1:25
problems that we're trying to solve and
1:27
tracking carbon
1:29
um off chain or just anywhere in the in
1:30
the real world
1:32
um we can look at Carbon markets
1:35
um those have been where most of the
1:36
activity around uh measuring and
1:39
tracking carbon over time have occurred
1:42
um so over the last 20 years with the
1:44
voluntary carbon Market a lot of the
1:46
procedures for measuring reporting and
1:48
verifying carbon sequestration has been
1:50
largely analog so it's been literally
1:53
paper and pencil or just an Excel
1:55
spreadsheet
1:56
um and sometimes it's it's uploaded into
1:59
a PDF but that's not even machine
2:01
readable so there are a lot of
2:03
opportunities to automate those
2:06
processes and increase the efficiency
2:08
and also the transparency of how this is
2:10
done and of course science evolves over
2:13
time different methodologies for
2:15
measuring how carbon is being
2:18
sequestered or removed so it makes sense
2:21
that we'll have to update the science
2:23
over time and then update how we measure
2:25
as well
2:27
um so I think that's something that
2:28
tracking on chain can help us with in
2:30
terms of transparency over time how the
2:32
science has changed to help us have a
2:34
bit more on intellectual honesty about
2:36
how we're conducting this work and with
2:39
auditability being able to look back in
2:41
time on an immutable ledger so tracking
2:43
something on blockchain allows you it's
2:46
it's tamper proof right you you can't
2:48
change it once it's stored so you can
2:50
have a lot higher confidence in the data
2:52
itself and building in points of
2:54
automation with with smart contracts or
2:57
or with um just automated calculation
2:59
even can help remove some of those risks
3:03
for human error in the process so at a
3:06
broad view I think those are a lot of
3:07
the opportunities to say nothing of the
3:10
financial opportunity of what
3:11
decentralized Finance might allow for us
3:13
as well
3:15
mm-hmm yeah you have you you mentioned a
3:18
few things there I want to go I want to
3:20
Circle back on that decentralized
3:21
Finance aspect later but whenever you
3:24
said that a number of that a lot of this
3:27
Con a lot of this information is is you
3:29
know tracked on on pin on pen and paper
3:32
or pencil and paper right depending on
3:34
where it is do you foresee
3:37
do you foresee
3:39
what the advancements in AI do you
3:41
foresee
3:43
hey I have an impact on this on trying
3:46
to have an AI read read some of that
3:48
some of that older information and kind
3:50
of transferring that information on
3:52
chain and if so like how do you envision
3:55
that I just now thought of that so it
3:57
may not even be
4:00
question uh I I'm
4:02
I I'm not super well versed in AI so um
4:06
I'm I'm I wonder if
4:10
um different AI or machine learning
4:12
models could help us to sift through
4:15
that Legacy data that is collected I
4:18
wonder if it could help us come up with
4:20
um different Trends or or just um help
4:24
us to process that that wealth of data
4:26
that does exist if it was in a machine
4:29
readable format first of all so if it
4:31
was all digital uh perhaps different AI
4:34
tools could help with that but that's
4:35
part of the problem too a lot of this
4:37
data is stored in very different formats
4:39
it's not uh it's it's not uh all
4:42
readable in a unified way so I think
4:44
that's probably part of Step One
4:47
um that's as much as I can say at this
4:48
point though
4:50
yeah yeah so so given that given that
4:54
it's in different formats
4:57
do you have any kind of insight on how
4:59
you can how we can kind of standardize
5:02
can standardize this information where
5:04
we can have
5:07
not really like us well
5:10
I can't say that centralized platform
5:11
because we're not trying to move into
5:13
centralization but have like a Common
5:16
Language or or a type of a standard for
5:18
for all of this all of this tracking
5:20
does that make sense
5:22
yeah I think you could compile
5:25
data potentially in a central repository
5:29
but collected through decentralized
5:31
methods so
5:33
um I think you could create something
5:35
like a single source of Truth where data
5:37
is pulled from many different uh servers
5:40
many different file types and converted
5:43
into a more open source database so if
5:46
you were to have kind of like a a
5:48
Central Library of of climate data
5:51
that's publicly accessible it's a
5:53
digital public good that everyone could
5:55
tap into
5:56
um uh and and access for high quality
6:00
climate data could that then help
6:02
standardize kind of how
6:05
um how climate work is conducted if we
6:06
were all operating off of the same song
6:08
sheet
6:11
okay
6:13
so so I know you mentioned I know you
6:15
mentioned decentralized Finance now I
6:17
want to kind of kind of go into that
6:18
space a little bit delve into that a
6:20
little bit you know how do you think
6:23
so in your opinion because I've I've
6:25
received different difference
6:28
statements on there so
6:30
are you saying that
6:32
that you know this sustainability
6:34
movement this this carbon carbon
6:37
tracking movement is going to be in a
6:39
default space or do you think it's going
6:41
to create like a new
6:44
I knew I knew
6:46
bucket for lack of a better term of this
6:49
refi that that people are are referring
6:52
to it as
6:54
I think
6:56
I think there will be a number of
6:57
different applications I think
7:00
um where decentralized Finance tools
7:02
come in are they can help us tap into
7:04
new areas of liquidity so again if
7:08
you're talking about
7:09
tracking carbon for the purposes of
7:13
um incentivizing different behaviors
7:15
let's say you're you're using credit
7:17
carbon credits as a medium or as some
7:20
kind of token of exchange to incentivize
7:23
a certain behavior and you want to
7:25
reward or punish certain behaviors you
7:27
know we could also think about a carbon
7:29
tax but let's stick with maybe the
7:31
credit analogy here
7:34
um if you are
7:36
you know there are a couple reasons why
7:37
you might invest in a carbon credit you
7:40
could
7:40
um
7:41
purchase it invest in it for the
7:44
purposes of retiring it and claiming the
7:46
environmental benefit right
7:48
um and maybe I'm uh maybe I'm a large
7:50
corporation or I'm a um an industry
7:54
partner and I have a carbon balance that
7:56
I need to account for or want to account
7:58
for and I'm going to claim that
7:59
environmental benefit by investing in
8:01
carbon credits
8:02
or
8:04
um
8:04
you could use it as a financial
8:06
instrument you know you could you could
8:08
see it as a digital environmental asset
8:10
a new asset class that if I hold I think
8:13
this is going to be more valuable in the
8:15
future maybe I want to resell it now
8:17
there are various pros and cons to that
8:20
approach but
8:22
um one thing that it can help us with as
8:23
a financial instrument is to channel
8:25
more Capital into carbon projects
8:28
so
8:30
if we if we look at the tools of of defy
8:33
and and different liquidity pools that
8:35
exist on blockchain
8:38
um that really could be a method if we
8:40
if we track credits on chain it could
8:42
help be a method of channeling new
8:44
streams of Finance new streams of
8:46
capital into you know the important
8:50
carbon sequestration projects that we
8:51
need to be scaling up across the world
8:53
and that's how you transfer the capital
8:54
into real world climate action
8:58
excellent okay
9:00
so so based on so I don't know I
9:04
understand that that you all work with
9:05
the number of of different of different
9:07
groups and you know based on your
9:10
experience what what what current
9:13
challenges do you all face or what
9:16
challenges or kind of drawbacks do you
9:19
see
9:21
um with with
9:23
Enterprise adoption you know individual
9:25
adoption as well as Enterprise adoption
9:27
that's like probably four questions
9:28
there but
9:30
yeah for Enterprise adoption I think
9:34
and I think this applies to larger
9:36
institutions as well and some corporate
9:37
Partners I think there's you know this
9:40
is still a very new space
9:42
um so just a level of awareness
9:46
um you know thankfully climate is
9:48
becoming more
9:50
um more of a focal point in global
9:53
conversations
9:54
um in industry in government
9:57
um in in politics and just in in civil
9:59
Affairs as well
10:01
um
10:02
and I think that uh so a lot of folks
10:05
are starting to think about okay how can
10:07
I uh keep track of my carbon footprint
10:10
how can I start to measure this and then
10:11
how can I do something about it there's
10:13
a lot of focus on climate these days and
10:15
that's fantastic but
10:17
um there's not always an understanding
10:19
of well how how does blockchain come in
10:22
what why does this matter you know what
10:24
are the benefits why should I care
10:25
essentially so I think that the biggest
10:27
challenge right now is just that uh
10:30
basic level of raising awareness and and
10:33
um and maybe you could call it a
10:35
communication challenge of of sharing
10:37
what are the key benefits of uh
10:39
blockchain how can it help uh provide
10:42
solutions to the challenges that we face
10:44
in coordinating Mass climate effort
10:46
across the globe
10:48
um
10:48
and then secondary to that to that
10:51
awareness and communication is
10:54
um is building trust so I think there
10:57
have been a lot of branding issues you
10:59
could say in the in the web three you
11:01
know in the blockchain space
11:03
um there's sometimes a a an impression
11:07
that uh this is the wild west and it can
11:10
come with a lot of scams and you know
11:13
um and that there are a lot of
11:14
opportunities out there to lose your
11:16
money or to have no impact and basically
11:17
to get swindled so I think
11:20
um this is a real credibility issue why
11:22
would corporates why would uh why would
11:25
companies let alone individuals want to
11:27
get involved in something if they don't
11:28
have faith in it if they if they think
11:30
it's a scam
11:32
um so I think that's another part of
11:33
Education that is incumbent upon this
11:35
community to be communicating better
11:37
that actually
11:39
this enhances you know our transparency
11:42
and verifiability actually this this
11:44
makes data a lot more accessible
11:47
um it actually you know enables new
11:49
governance methods so you open up uh
11:52
decision rights to to more audiences
11:55
that may not have had them in the past
11:57
so
11:58
um I think
11:59
communicating how these tools really
12:02
solve problems will help more audiences
12:05
to understand what the benefit is and
12:07
and why this this has such a
12:09
revolutionary potential
12:11
um in the climate space
12:14
I like that I like that and I like how
12:17
you I like how you brought up the
12:18
whenever whenever we struggle with the
12:20
with the linkages you know between
12:22
between real world use cases and
12:24
blockchain you know because I think that
12:26
that's one of the current issues in my
12:28
opinion that's one of the current issues
12:30
that we have now whereas you know some
12:32
of these projects are Building Solutions
12:34
but there's no linkage to a real world
12:36
use case right so
12:42
credibility yep that's that's a big
12:44
problem you know and you know so you did
12:48
you did kind of touch on some of this
12:51
but in your opinion
12:53
how do we how do we get
12:56
you might be repeating yourself here but
12:58
how do we get you know two two you know
13:01
what adoption of of you know refi or or
13:05
you know building building
13:07
sustainability building sustainable use
13:10
cases sustainability use cases right on
13:14
only using blockchain
13:16
foreign
13:17
I would take
13:19
kind of a two-pronged approach I would
13:21
take
13:22
um
13:22
kind of a a large scale approach so you
13:26
target Enterprise you target
13:27
institutions you target groups who have
13:30
huge business operations and if they if
13:33
they Implement a new technology it
13:36
really offers a step change in
13:38
um in in any given industry and they can
13:42
also serve as kind of an anchor customer
13:43
to overcome those credibility issues
13:45
right so if I'm operating in
13:48
transportation and I say I'm I see a
13:50
major Trucking Company utilizing
13:53
blockchain to track its emissions for
13:55
its supply chain
13:56
that changes uh that changes the
13:59
landscape that that changes
14:01
um you know how it how that company gets
14:03
to compete in the space if they have
14:04
enhanced data if they have lower costs
14:07
if they have particular business
14:09
advantages from the adoption of this
14:11
technology it may trigger others in
14:14
certain industries to adopt that as well
14:15
so
14:17
um think about cloud storage for example
14:20
uh any new technology needs a first a
14:23
few first movers and early adopters to
14:27
make something more mainstream and
14:28
widely adopted so going with Enterprise
14:32
and going with institutions gives you a
14:35
lot more visibility and it allows you to
14:37
have a larger impact at a larger scale
14:41
through through
14:43
more efficient Partnerships that you're
14:45
investing in essentially
14:47
um and then I would also take you know
14:49
so if you go large scale and you go
14:51
Enterprise and institutional
14:53
um also be looking at uh community and
14:56
individual use because the applications
14:58
and the benefits and this comes back to
15:00
the individual problems that either
15:02
businesses or institutions or
15:04
individuals face they're all going to be
15:06
different so if you're designing a
15:07
solution you need to design it around
15:09
what is the actual problem that it's
15:11
solving
15:12
um and for individuals and communities I
15:15
think regenerative Finance or you know
15:18
blockchain enabled tools have unique
15:20
advantages that are different from what
15:22
you might offer to a business or to an
15:24
institution
15:25
so if businesses and institutions might
15:28
care a lot about
15:29
the data integrity
15:33
um and what it enables in terms of
15:34
tracking their supply chain to an
15:36
individual what these tools might be
15:38
able to open up is new revenue streams
15:40
new forms of earning income if I am
15:43
measuring
15:45
um on the ground uh the the evolution of
15:48
a carbon project maybe I'm reforesting
15:51
mangroves maybe I've been planting
15:52
mangroves there are ways that using a
15:55
blockchain enabled technology to monitor
15:57
the state of that natural asset the
16:00
state of that mangrove forest could
16:02
reward me with certain incentives after
16:04
I upload data and maybe I can earn
16:06
revenue for for a project like that this
16:08
is actually a pilot that a group called
16:11
gain forest and sell a foundation have
16:13
have been testing out in the Philippines
16:15
is exactly that or perhaps it enables me
16:19
to access new
16:21
um new asset classes that I never had
16:23
before as an individual perhaps it
16:26
allows me to overcome
16:28
certain fees or or unlock greater
16:32
efficiency with trading resources as far
16:35
as it comes to preserving natural
16:37
Community Resources so it all comes down
16:40
to what is the problem that you want to
16:42
address and and how do you frame the
16:44
solution whether that's for
16:46
um a business and or an institution or
16:49
to an individual or to a community
16:51
um and there are really a lot of
16:53
wide-ranging use cases that are being
16:55
explored in the refi space right now and
16:57
that's personally what I find so
16:59
fascinating
17:02
I like that I like that so is there any
17:07
is there anything else that that you
17:09
would want to add
17:12
in terms of in terms of this discussion
17:14
in terms of what more people should
17:16
should do and or do you have like a
17:19
caller action you know in this space
17:22
I would say it's still very early days
17:25
right so a lot of groups are
17:28
are still in what I would call like
17:31
spaghetti on the wall stage just like
17:33
throwing and seeing what sticks there's
17:35
a lot of innovation happening it's an
17:36
incredibly Dynamic space so I would say
17:39
stay tuned because there's a lot that's
17:41
being experimented with and coming out
17:43
and we need to do more right this is
17:44
where Innovation takes place and and I
17:46
find that really exciting
17:48
um but we're also looking for new real
17:51
world use cases
17:53
um because by proving out how something
17:55
impacts climate work tangibly on the
17:57
ground that's where we're going to build
17:59
the most confidence I think in in uh in
18:02
these applications and
18:04
um that's where we can really help to
18:06
build trust and help to promote adoption
18:08
is by demonstrating to someone how this
18:11
offers a tangible benefit either to
18:13
their business or to their individual
18:14
life
18:16
excellent so Allison thank you thank you
18:19
for your time uh where can people where
18:21
can people find you
18:24
um you can find the climate Collective
18:26
online at climatecollective.org
18:29
um we're also on LinkedIn and on Twitter
18:32
all right thank you once again thank you
18:35
for your time and for everyone else
18:36
until next time
