VeChain Foundation Climate Research - Justin Goldston Interviews Daniel Krupka of Coin Bureau
Video Link - https://youtu.be/GHhNak2dhjg

Yeah, so my name is Daniel, I'm the Head of Research at the coin Bureau are the largest YouTube channel about cryptocurrency, you can think of me as kind of being the back end to guys front end, for simplicity's sake. And yeah, and yeah, that's it.

00:29
All right, I like it short and sweet. So So, um, we briefly talked about this interview, talked about the work we're doing, we're doing with V chain to, to understand among among industry leaders as to the desirability and feasibility of tracking carbon credits, carbon offsets carbon emissions on the blockchain, as well, as you know, this whole this whole emerging topic of refi. So So can you, you know, begin to to give give your thoughts on on any one of those topics or all of those topics?

01:08
Yeah, sounds good. So, I don't know. I mean, I imagine if the viewers are, you know, if they know v chain, chances are they know the coin bureau. But we did a video about carbon credits, I think it was a couple months back, and I did the research for that one. So I do actually have quite quite a bit to say there. I guess I'll start by saying that my biggest concern about carbon credits in general, is basically Well, one is that there are no kind of like global standards, I think that something has been raised many times as well. There's kind of like a global standard for what counts, you know, what, what? I don't know, like, how many how many trees needs to be planted for it to count as one, you know, as one kilogram of co2? or what have you. That's been removed from from the atmosphere. So one is the absence of standards. The second issue is kind of, well, basically, that a lot of these carbon credits, I mean, to, I'm not going to use any explicit language here, but let's just say that they're they're just, they're just scams, basically, you're selling it like, again, because there is no, because there are no standards, because there's, there seems to be, there seems to be lacking regulation, that you basically have, you know, people that are saying, you know, yeah, of course, like, you know, here you can, I don't know, here's a carbon credit that I'm just going to sell to you, because of this piece of land that I have, and I'm gonna, I'm gonna keep it nice and safe. But you know, they were never planning on building out in any way. And, you know, they basically have all this money coming in. And it's yeah, there was an article that I'd sent you, Justin from The Guardian recently, something like 97% of carbon credits issued by like the largest carbon credit issuer, basically, they actually don't reduce carbon. Now, there's been lots of concerns that even the whole scheme of carbon credits, basically, like, incentivizes because it's like you, you don't actually reduce any emissions, you just, you just pay, you just ask people to pay for it. And, and if that money is not used wisely, then in the end, all you're doing is just, you're just creating basically another speculative market, which, you know, to be honest, this is this is kind of what I, what I think a lot of these refi projects are kind of doing is they're, they're trying to tap into the speculative aspect of, you know, the carbon credits market where, you know, it's, if you think about it, at least again, and I'm happy to be corrected on this, if either you just didn't know or if someone you know, feel free to reach out or reach out to me on on LinkedIn, or Twitter or what have you. But my understanding of carbon credit markets is that obviously, the goal is to reduce carbon. So that means that every single year, the amount of carbon credits that can be issued is reduced. And if you just simple supply, and demand dynamics tells you that the price of this carbon credits are gonna go up over time. So this is this is, you know, there therein lies the speculative aspect, you're basically it's literally like investing like another kind of like, like Bitcoin. But the problem is that this Bitcoin that we're talking about, is not transparent, at least again, like I'm not talking about the blockchain part, I'm talking about the actual issuance of carbon credits, the actual issue, issuance of carbon credits, is not transparent. You can't really verify anything that's going on. And the bigger issue is that if you if you do end up in a scenario, and this is, you know, this touches on a bigger issue, if you do end up having global standards, and I know that I think the United Nations is working on like a global carbon credit system or something like this, but if you end up with a centralized authority that takes control of the whole carbon credits, then what you're investing in when you're buying, you know, like, either with weather, I mean, I don't want to name any names, but from any of these real life projects, when you buy these tokenized carbon credits, you're basically you're basically buying kind of like a stable coin that has properties that are similar to Bitcoin, if that makes any sense, where the issuing authority behind those carbon credits could anytime they can see that, you know, one of these refi projects for whatever reason, we don't like what they're doing, so we're no longer gonna issue carbon credits to them. And all of a sudden the value of those tokens goes to nothing. And this is again, this is a an issue where when you get a headline saying that 97% of the carbon credits from this particular issue, were faulty and don't reduce carbon, then what does that do to the price of the tokenized version of that asset? Right like what you see it's the equivalent of if someone said, hey, the reserves for you know one of the largest stable coins has been seized or is not imagined someone came and said 97 For percent of the reserves for tether, you know, which some would say is the case, but I don't think it is. But let's just say for sake of argument, if 97% of the reserves for tether were actually worthless, then what would happen to the price of USD T, obviously, it would go down. And that's, you know, that's obviously a financial risk, there's a huge risk to the protocols that are otherwise doing really good work. So that's, that's kind of like, I guess, a couple thoughts there. The other thing that I'll throw out, and then I'll let you jump in there, just because, you know, I can keep going forever. But the other thing that I'll mention, is that, you know, do when it comes to this issue, and I guess, and trading of carbon credits, is that something that, you know, specific people actually want to be transparent? Do people actually want to know, do these institutions actually want to know, are these institutions want you to be able to see how many carbon credits they hold? Do they want you to see when they're moving carbon credits around, there's a case to be made, the institutions don't want that. And it's my personal belief that, you know, as much as privacy has been, you know, the, the the kind of black sheep of the crypto industry, ultimately, it's going to be the institutions, the central banks, the governments, you know, when when, when central banks start buying cryptocurrency in 2025, they're going to start calling for some privacy protections, because they don't want you to be able to see how much Bitcoin certain central bank holds. And I think that you already saw the, I guess, to go on a little bit of a tangent, but you're already kind of seeing this with the, we already saw this with a tap root upgrade, which, you know, like tap root, whatever it's, it sounds like it's nothing. But in short, what tap root did for Bitcoin is it made all the transactions appear the same, whether it's a multisig, whether it's going and joining the Lightning Network, whether it's a atomic swap, and all of a sudden, you've created actually, when you have a separate layer, you can now interact with different layers of Bitcoin with some degree of privacy. And I imagine we're gonna see something similar with the carbon credits, where they're probably going to end up migrating to sort of layer two, that's going to be specifically for refi. And maybe I'm making a big prediction now. But But I think I think that, you know, similarly to NF T's, I think the biggest opportunity in Rifai is going to be actually whatever base layer is powering these tokens, and I do think it's going to be a layer two, I mean, it could be a layer one, but I have a feeling it's going to be a layer two that's on something like Aetherium because, again, institutions want security more than anything else. And the most secure blockchains you know, for better or for worse for the time being are Bitcoin and Aetherium. So so this is kind of I guess we're anyway, I could keep going on the tangent, but I hope you have some some interesting thoughts there.

07:14
No, you actually, yeah, I got about four, I got about four bullets here. But you bring up an excellent point in terms of in terms of privacy, in that, you know, I come I come from a supply chain industry, right. And whenever I whenever I asked, you know, leaders of organizations, you know, about blockchain, you know, there's their primary concern, the privacy, we don't want to our our data, our data is our competitive advantage, and all these things like that. So you make an excellent point, you make an excellent point when you talk about the whole privacy piece. And that's one that's one thing. That's one thing I talk about a lot. And that I think that zero knowledge proofs, once it once the enterprise has come in, I think zero knowledge proofs are going to be massive. I think that your knowledge proofs are going to that. I think zero knowledge proofs are going to be the thing that solution, that tool that kind of gets in gets these organizations and to the blockchain space, right? Because once they know what it now it's gonna take, it's gonna take someone like you all to kind of create the education so that they understand it. Right. But But once they once they get to that once they get to education, once they get to that point, then they'll understand that that that zero knowledge proofs may may provide, you know, the privacy that you know, they're they're concerned about, which which turns a lot of these organizations away, you know, from from blockchain, because they think the guest Yes, is transparent right. Now. Going back to everything you said. If we include zero knowledge proofs, do you think that do you think that blockchain could be a viable solution to kind of, to kind of alleviate some of your concerns that you that you spoke about?

09:10
Yeah, I mean, I think so. But again, the my bigger concern, I guess, and I probably should emphasize a little bit more as my I mean, I guess I didn't really mention it. But my biggest concern, in general with carbon credits is kind of, you know, again, the goal, again, is to reduce carbon, which you could make the argument, you know, whether reducing carbon all the way down to zero is something that you necessarily want to do in an economy. That's, you know, that's that's a debate that can be had. But not only that, but what kind of is what I'm really concerned about when it comes to whether it's tokenized or not. What I'm concerned about is the incentive that the whole carbon credit scheme is going to create because again, if you like, right now, at least my understanding, and again, feel free to correct me or anyone can correct me here, but carbon credits are restricted, I think, and Justin, you had mentioned this, I think before we started speaking that carbon credits are really right now more geared towards institutional use, and that but this is something that is because I guess at least in Europe, for example, like institutions, basically, they have to buy carbon credits to offset, you know, some x amounts. And each year, the European Union reduces the amount of carbon credits that are available, because of course, they're trying to reduce the carbon emissions. But the but so you know, that's all well and good. But what happens when you start to apply this to, let's say, two people, where you actually do introduce, like an individual carbon credit score, which is kind of like the more dystopian element of what we had mentioned in our video, where, basically every year the government or whoever would give you X amount of carbon credits that you can spend, and then what happens to people who are, you know, less fortunate, who are, you know, historically, you could say, like Mark marginalized, where they're basically forced to, you know, basically, to not consume any carbon whatsoever, and basically, in some cases, probably literally almost killed themselves to to not use any carbon so that they can sell it for money so that they continue to survive. And each year that that amount gets smaller and smaller. Meanwhile, the rich folks who have the closest connections to the organizations that are going to be issuing these carbon credits, whether it's the government, whether it's the United Nations, the individual, it'll be literally the same thing that we have today with with fiat money, where the people who are have the closest connections to the commercial banks and the central banks, they can borrow directly at a rate that no one else can, and then they buy up all the assets, and then they use those assets as collateral to borrow even more. And if they default, when the government bails them out, and we're gonna see the exact same thing, in my opinion, if we go down this path, we're gonna see the exact same thing happened with carbon credits, where at the beginning, it's I think, it's actually gonna be really good. But then over time, you're gonna see these really perverse incentives evolve the same way they did in the traditional financial system. And you're basically going to see all these institutions just getting richer and richer, because they have the closest connections to the issuance of these, the issuers of these carbon credits. I personally think that the best thing that blockchain could do as zero knowledge proofs or not, whether it's the biggest thing that Rifai could do is find some way of in a decentralized way, issuing decentralized carbon credits that do not require a centralized issuer, where you can actually have verifiable proof that yes, this this carbon was reduced, you could potentially do this, you know, using peer to peer networks, something like helium, where you can set up sensors, and you can show proof of, you know, things like, you know, you can really get some really interesting ideas. But in my personal opinion, there's two ways that refi can go either refi can decide that they're basically going to be a stable coin issuer, that of a stable, an issuer of an asset that, you know, is going to have the same perverse incentives as a fiat currency, and they'll get rich in the process. But if they roll that central bank, digital currencies, then all the money they make will be worthless anyway, but that's a topic for another time. But but, you know, either they can go that path, or they can decide, you know, what, we're going to do things differently, instead of, instead of integrating with the existing system, we're going to disrupt it, we're going to make some sort of decentralized carbon credit, that can be verified by anyone that anyone can issue where I can basically prove and be like, you know, look, this, you know, this month or this week, I, you know, I traveled less, or I consumed less, and you can prove that to the blockchain, and the blockchain will reward you with a carbon credit. And you don't have to go to some centralized issuer and you won't have the same perverse dynamics. Come on. That's, that's kind of my my thoughts there. But anyway, I hope I hope that made a little bit of sense there.

13:03
Oh, yeah, it did. It did. And kind of I'm gonna try, I'm gonna try. I'm gonna try. I'm gonna try it a little, a little guy saying, right, so. So what you're telling me is, Chris, maybe a new gold?

13:23
Yeah, well, if they're done if they're done correctly, yeah, I mean, 100%. It's like, if you can, if you can make, and again, it does beg the question of, you know, whether whether reducing carbon and like, how much carbon do you actually want to reduce, you actually want to go all the way to zero? Because if you go all the way to zero with no alternative energy source, or what have you, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You're gonna end up like Sri Lanka, you're gonna end up like, you know, I don't know, South Africa is maybe not a good example right now. But Sri Lanka is definitely a good example there. You don't want to, you know, you have to almost you have to question the whole basis of the scheme itself, where you know, it, and again, sorry to go on the tangent, Justin, but I think it's something that's worth noting something potentially that, you know, Rifai could also potentially address. But take a second to consider that the whole reason why we have all these, like, the whole purpose of carbon credits is is to you know, is to reduce the damage on the or I guess, lower the damage that humans are doing to the environment, basically. But if you really think about it, the whole reason why we have all this damage to the environment is because of overconsumption and overconsumption comes from the incentive in an inflationary currencies that are losing value, there's an incentive to spend, if you had a currency that actually held its value over time, then you would be incentivized to save rather than spend, you would only spend on the absolute necessities consumption would come down naturally, you wouldn't have to pass a single law. And and all this, you know, this, this natural reduction in consumption just from this chain, the small change in incentives for making a monetary system that can be inflated that's constantly inflationary versus one that is actually deflationary. And, of course, the you know, the powerful people don't want a deflationary system, because deflation makes debt more expensive and all these governments and corporations have a bunch of debt, but if you actually want to solve climate change and all these things that that all these reflagged projects ultimately want to do, then the way you do that is by creating a hard money system, a sound money system where there's deflation, that incentivizes people to spend rather than save, that reduces the overconsumption. And you can have a planet with, you know, five or 10 times potentially 10 times more people, and it'd be completely fine. Why? Because the average person would only consume what they absolutely need to which at the end of the day, this is what carbon credits are supposed to do to they're incentivizing people not to consume less, but you don't have to create this huge centralized crazy scheme, all you have to do is change the money, and that'll fix so many issues, whether it's wealth inequality, and what and all these things, I truly believe because all that will happen is all these again, like, my mother is Colombian. Okay, so I like I my background, you know, there's there's real poverty in places like Colombia and Latin America. And, and a lot of it comes from the fact that the, you know, at least in places, let's say, like El Salvador, where they use a foreign currency that's constantly being inflated, and they just have no chance. And anyway, I guess it's, uh, yeah, I apologies for the tangent there. But I feel free to bring us back on track there, just

15:59
keep the tangents because that's, that's how that's how I get nuggets. Whenever people start start talking about things that are passionate about, that's where that's where nuggets come from. Right. So. So whenever you're whenever you want to open up when on your last run, whenever you were on your last Bull Run, right, I wrote down, I wrote down. So, you know, we say that it's hard to kind of validate some of these claims that these organizations are saying in terms of carbon credits, and I had a call, I like to call with uma with uma yesterday, yesterday about their optimistic Oracle. Right. So although although, you know, they're using their Oracle primarily for prediction markets, do you see a place for for or a need for Oracle's within within the sustainability space? And for 100%?

16:56
Yeah, 100% I mean, whether whether we're talking carbon credits, or NF T's, or what have you, the name of the game is going to be infrastructure. So you're gonna need like you said, you're gonna need an Oracle, you're gonna need somewhere to store the data, you know, who has what, because, you know, unfortunately, these blockchains, some of these block chains are becoming very big actually, recall. And again, V chain community feel free to grill me. But I remember last time, when we had updated, done an update on the project, what V chain developers were actually concerned, they had mentioned an injury, that they're concerned that the blockchain is becoming too large, too quickly. And this is what happens to every single crypto project that has a fast transaction speed, because what happens is basically you're creating the size of the blockchain just grows, you know, I guess you could say, like, like, just very quickly, I was gonna say exponentially. But that's not technically correct. But in any case, you know, decentralized data storage, it would be really interesting, I think, again, from Rifai in this niche, whether it's V chain or otherwise, to think like, is it possible, like you were saying to create, even potentially, like an Oracle that's specifically designed for carbon credits? Is it possible to create a data store a decentralized data storage solution that is specifically for the storage of tokenized carbon, or the storage of transaction history of tokenized carbon credits, you know, to to because again, like, and this ties into, you know, Justin, you may or may not be familiar with, with Cosmos, where the idea behind cosmos is that every single application is eventually going to need to need its own blockchain, because it's gonna have too much adoption. I think that the same thing applies to infrastructure, where, you know, everyone assumes oh, we're gonna use chain link, but no, and like, you know, everyone's gonna use chain like, and there's no room for competition, that's, I'm sorry, but that's BS, what's gonna happen is that over time, there's gonna be so much data, there's gonna be so much demand for infrastructure that you're going to need, you're going to need an ummah with this optimistic. With this optimistic Oracle, you're going to need some, you're going to need probably dozens, probably hundreds of Oracle's, and you're going to and, you know, rather than just having a chain for each DAP, someday, you might actually need a decentralized storage solution, and an Oracle, and all these other, you know, node hosting services, stuff like an anchor, and, and these projects, which escaped me now, but, you know, you're like, the potential and refi in my again, in my opinion, comes fundamentally from the building of infrastructure, IT projects can build infrastructure and focus less, less so on tokenizing, like, as anyone like tokenizing, the carbon credit, that's the easy part, that's the get rich, quick and fast part. If you want something that's gonna, that's gonna last and something that's actually going to have use, then creating a custom Oracle for refi creating a custom or decentralized data storage solution and what have you, that I think that's where the potential is, and I'm not sure if that's something that humans seeking to address, but, but that's something potentially looking at worth looking into as a refi project. Yeah,

19:35
I like that one. I love I love that one. Yeah, so yeah. So any, anything anything else? We covered? We covered? We covered a lot, we've covered a lot. Um, I want to come in and transcribe and transcribe this interview. This was this was a good one. Do you have anything else you wanted to add in terms of you know, how we can bring how we can actually leverage blockchain to Have to assist in this sustainability effort that everybody talks about. Because, you know, when we're talking about sustainability, I've been in this space a lot, I've created, I created a, I created a course for for University of Southern California for their new sustainability program. And over the last couple of years, it's just a lot of talk in terms of sustainability in terms of reducing, you know, reducing carbon emission becoming carbon negative and things like that, you know, so something I'm very passionate about. And again, I came, I come from an industry. So I know, I know, a lot of this stuff is just talk. So I think that maybe maybe I'm just being too optimistic, where I'm saying, if we, if you're saying you're gonna do it, put on the blockchain and prove it. Right. You know, so that's always kind of been my mantra. So, you know, do you have anything else to add to or any other thoughts to how we can leverage this and it doesn't have to be blockchain, how we can leverage technology to kind of move more toward this, this this, this this vision that we all that we all look to, to?

21:13
Well, I don't know if you know this, Justin, but this is Alana, the founder of Salon Argus creator of Salon, I know, there's technically co founders, whatever, and a totally echo CO is actually also really passionate about addressing environmental issues through blockchain and cryptocurrency and I think he mentioned in the interview once that, you know, if he wasn't doing Solana, then he would be trying to do something basically unrefined. And what's what's really fascinating to me is that I think that there's potential, again, like, the crypto industry, and I guess this relates to another discussion that we had earlier. But the crypto industry, I think, has to has to think less about trying to integrate with existing because, again, like you were saying, like the existing systems of addressing things like sustainability, it's mostly talk and not much gets done. why would why anyone would want to integrate with such a system. And again, of course, the reason why they want to integrate is because they want to make money quickly, because there's all these, you know, government spending programs or whatever they're going towards the sector so that people can get paid to basically sit around and talk and do nothing. But I mean, I hope that that's not coming off as too aggressive. But if you if you if you were to change, I guess like again, don't don't the crypto industry can't think of like going in and integrating with the existing system. I truly believe that the whole point of crypto is to create alternatives that will actually disrupt and address these issues. So when it comes to something like sustainability, I do think that there is a potential for you know, for for a crypto project, whether it's a blocked whether it's refi or what have you even something a great example actually, which you may or may not may not have heard about is something like algoryn where on the Algren blockchain, the validators actually don't earn any block rewards. And so these are transaction fees. So what happens to these transaction fees is they basically get sent to like a random wallet address, and they just sit there and they do nothing. And what the algorithm Foundation decided, or I don't know Algren community, and I don't want to put words in their mouth, but what they decided to do was to use these transaction fees to actually buy carbon credits to make the auger and blockchain carbon neutral, which is, you know, a clever way of doing it. But now imagine, imagine a scenario where you could take a portion of transaction fees from something like Aetherium. And you could use that to build a solar farm or build a wind farm or ideally, build a nuclear power plant that is actually safe, because again, you know, everyone is, you know, really paranoid about nuclear, but you have to remember and Justin, you probably know this, that there was a huge breakthrough in Fusion recently, right? Yeah, fusion and fusion, nuclear, there's a huge breakthrough. And they're saying, Oh, it's gonna be it's gonna be 10 years before we see it, why you want you wanna know why because there's, there's all this regulation, there's all this red tape, there's too many people in rooms discussing how they're going to do it, whatever, what you If If fusion is known to be something that is safe to experiment with, which I don't know if it is, but let's just say for sake of argument that it is then you can have a cryptocurrency, you can have a Dao, you can have a refi Dao pool all this money together to create a fusion reactor in the next couple of years instead of in a couple of decades. And you could get started on on going to, you know, on reducing carbon emissions in like, you know, immediately and people forget one thing, sorry to go on tangent again, you're Justin. But one thing that people forget is that it's not just about the money, it's about the time, imagine if you were able to build a fusion reactor, you know, crowdfund the development of a fusion reactor with a cryptocurrency in two or three years. And then you have seven years of that of that fusion reactor, basically creating limitless amounts of energy versus waiting that extra seven years and then making it you don't I mean, the, the gains that would be had in those seven years leading up would just be so incredible for all of society. And so crypto has to stop thinking it's like, oh, how do we how do we backpack and get, you know, get more of this, like fiat money from these institutions that again, like, you know, in my opinion, that money is eventually going to be worth nothing anyway, you know, radical, radical thought. But you know, why not? Instead focus on why don't we crowdfund and build something. Why don't we build what just just build like a like a solar farm, buy some land and build a solar farm, buy some land, buy some land and build a wind farm, see how it works, and actually have some financial incentives. Why not make it that whoever buys energy from this wind farm arm that money goes to the people who have participated in the doubt or participate in the crowdfunding? Why the hell do we need all these energy companies? Why the hell do we need all these governments to say, You know what? No, of course there needs to be some regulation don't get me wrong. But why do we need all this complex infrastructure and bureaucracy? Like why not? Why don't you just crowd fund it and build it yourself and then have the profits come to the Dow and then you can use that money to build it and keep building and keep building and keep building until another fusion reactor and other solar and start building solar panels in space? Like all this, you know, reach out to Elon Elon loves Dogecoin? Why don't you make some solar panels send them up to space, you could crowd fund that, you know, of course, individually, we're all you know, each of us, you know, relative to the people who are really wealthy relative to the central bankers, for sure. Individually, we don't have much money. But if we pull together and we push that money in a certain direction, then what we can do, we can do it faster and better. And this is something that Anatoly sees and all these other guys see. And I imagine a lot of guys in the refi industry also see this, that if we can work collectively, collectively together, and on the same page, we can, whatever what the government's are kind of planning now, with all these green new deals or whatever, we can do it faster and better and more transparently, and everything through through blockchain, if we just stop focusing on trying to jump on that bandwagon is oh, I want money from the green new deal to you know, make your own green New Deal. Well, let's work together. Let's do it together. And let's have it done, you know, in a couple of years or a couple of months instead of like a decade, right? Anyway, I hope that's a good note to end on.

26:17
Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Alright, so that was the last note. But I have one more question. What do you think? What do you think are the future doubts? Because you brought it up? And you brought up a good point. And two, you brought up a good point in a good use case for Dalles. In my opinion, I don't I don't I don't think that that like that may gain traction because I've we're dealing with people here

26:39
right? We're still dealing with people. I don't think people will see there's enough money in it.

26:45
So like, case you mentioned may not may not have legs. And that's a perfect use case for it. So So So in your opinion, how far how far out? Do you think that we are away from and we're talking about this in the bear market? Right and a bull market? I say oh downs are the future. But now that we've seen what happened with these dowels, what are your thoughts on dowels and the future dowels.

27:12
In short, I think it's gonna sound pretty horrible. But I think that I think that unless we find a new governance structure, then all Dows are going to fail. I know that's a that's a bold prediction to make. But I want you to imagine because right now, the way that the way that dowsers are set up is that they're set up in kind of like a democratic process. And the democracy is that one token equals one vote, which is not a very good democracy, because of course, the wealthiest I don't know, if you saw this headline, I think is something like 97% or something like 3% of the token holders, and like 97% of the voting power, some have seen or 87%, some obscene imbalance in voting power. But even even if you were to do a system, which of course they're trying to develop now as to you know, you have like a decentralized digital ID where it's like one person equals one vote, you have a direct democracy the same way you do it, you know, in some countries, then you then you run into the same issue because where it Where are all the decisions in the United? Well, I guess the United States is a different situation, because you have states and all this stuff. But for sake of argument, it's like all the power in the United Kingdom is concentrated in London, all the power, most of the power in the United States is concentrated in Washington. So if you create Dows, with with, you know, democratic systems or totalitarian systems are a dictatorship, you're going to end up with, you're eventually going to end up with the same centralization and issues that we see today. So we not only have the decentralized, so Dows not only need to decentralize, you know, the participation, they need to decentralize the structure itself. Otherwise, you're just going to the, the, the, I guess, the process of Dao voting is inherently centralizing. And that is going to lead to failure over time, because you're gonna end up with with a group of people that have a lot of influence. And you saw this recently with a venture capitalist fighting back and forth. And so what I personally think needs to happen is we need to have a new governance structure. And I actually came up with one and I'll save that for another discussion, but I came up with a governance structure that is neither democratic nor, nor dictatorial, because those are kind of like the two extremes. But there is a way there is a middle ground that you can have, where you can have a new governance structure, and if Dows can implement something along those lines, then as long as like, again, the the whole purpose of an organization, if the organization has bad governance, then the organization is doomed to fail, the way that Git dowsers structure today, they are all doomed to fail. They're all doomed to fail. And I'm gonna say that with 100% boldness, so there needs to be a change on that front. Anyway, that's
