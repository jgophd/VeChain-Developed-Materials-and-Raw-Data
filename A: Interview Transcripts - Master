Sure. Thank you, Justin. Thanks for having me here today. So, as Justin said, I'm Linda done. And I'm the faculty director for the supply chain management master's program at Georgetown University and School of Continuing Studies.

00:37
Thanks for Thanks for that. So. So at Georgetown, do you all do any they will do anything in the area of, of sustainability? And, you know, carbon emissions and carbon tracking? or what have you? What have you seen in that in that particular area?

00:55
Yeah, there's, first of all, just supply chain, there's tremendous interest in this area. Right. And I would say that the program at Georgetown, and you know, this, from some background, right, is very focused on corporate social responsibility. So both from an environmental impacts, and also social impacts, you know, how, how does the supply chain play a role? And how can we improve both the environment and the social impacts using supply chain thinking about supply chain. So really, that that is a major focus. And I'd say the university overall has done a lot of things and published it, you know, with green energy, just to focus on sustainability overall. And that's really a part of, you know, taking care of others in the world, sort of the Jesuit values that they have.

01:54
Excellent. So, so I'm no arch. So for full disclosure, I teach within the program at George at Georgetown as well. So, so here's, that's, that's one of the reasons why, you know, some of the questions will come up. That's gonna come up later on. But I know that you you have you have some some background in in blockchain. And I know that we talk about how to integrate blockchain within the industry, namely within the supply chain space. So how do you how do you see us leveraging this technology to make an impact from a carbon tracking perspective?

02:39
Sure, Justin, I think you know, anything that really needs to be proven, so to speak, is going to be a place where blockchain may play a role. And so right now, there's a lot of claims in sustainability. I'll even diverge just from carbon for a minute. But you know, just sustainability practices. We talk about greenwashing, what's real, what's not? As many companies are so focused on, you know, zero carbon or pledges and, you know, what can they do? And how do they measure, you know, really scope three, which is the hard part, which is the one more supply chain is involved, right? They're going to need to prove it. And they're going to need to do it in a way that they don't have to keep doing the same auditing, so to speak. That's the biggest issue right now is both the measurement, but then also the certification. And that's where I think blockchain will play a role with the certification. You know, it is hard to measure. There's a lot, you know, people don't have necessarily all the same definitions, when they even talk zero carbon. What about embedded carbon, you know, in the construction industry, and once it's already there. And so, once the measurement and the definitions start to form, at least, you know, stage one of it because I think it will continually be refined, someone has to be able to certify that. So there's a lot of groups out there now, similar to when Sarbanes Oxley came out. And you really with GAP had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, right? Someone had to sign off on it, that the financials were correct, indeed. And so with all that, that proving that which is where I think we are with carbon right now, then there's the audit statement, right. And for the most part, they're just doing an overall company. Here's the audit for the company. I think when you start to get with carbon, it's going to be by product. And to do that you don't want to do it again. And again, and again, you want to say I know the carbon footprint. And it might be that we actually have two pieces. This is the piece, you know, basically, before freight. Right, here's the piece, you know, this is what it is. And then there's a second piece that's associated with freight that might change for where the product is going. But the actual development and manufacture of the product and all the tier two, tier three suppliers, the measurement of that is all put on a blockchain, it's certified, you can prove that with customer, A, B, and C, because, again, you have 1000s of customers who want the same information. You can't you can't do each one separately, right. And so I think, because it's going to be at a product basis, instead of just a company, you're going to need a way to have that audit, have it certified and be able to each time present it. And I say you may separate freight, because obviously products can be moved all around the world. So there's to me there, it's almost like when you have a price in supply chain, right? And it's without the freight, you know, and then you add on the freight. So I think you might have the same thing. Here's the carbon measurement, here's the blockchain that proves it. And then there might be another one that gets generated with the freight. Just an ideas.

06:32
I love it. I love it. And so I know that we're big, we're big on this, you know, we hope that this is the utopian view, you know, of this space. But so given the given the kind of the, the, the rails of this of this study, you know, in terms of desirability, and feasibility given that you spend a lot of time in this space, given a lot of time at Aspen, I put time into space, what do you think the desirability is for a solution like this for those in the industry? Yeah, that's I know, that's a broad statement. But you know, think of the trucking companies think of those that do that do accidentally think of those that are there that they're they're just permanently focused on money? Right, you know, what's what, in your opinion, was the desirability or something like this?

07:26
I think the desirability is going to differ by industry a little bit, and it's going to differ by, you know, what's your role in the supply chain? So I think manufacturers first and foremost are going to be the most interested, just based on size, based on margin that they make. And, you know, those that have the ability, again, that don't want to replicate? Yes, this product has this carbon footprint, right? And this has has this level, I think you're gonna see it first in the manufacturing base, because it's natural there. After that, when you start to get to trucking companies, etc, that adoption would be afterwards, from my opinion, only because the margins for those types of companies tend to be thinner, right? It's like technology, where does that get any technology gets adopted, usually in industries that are have larger players and have better margins, that's, that's, you know, because they have the ability to put that in without hurting their p&l. And as a matter of fact, as it becomes required, I think the manufacturers will again, see blockchain as a way to implement something without having the repetitive cost, okay, it's gonna cost me I have to get audited, but it's one time. So that will be the savings from their perspective. The industries like trucking, and again, maritime will come along over time. And again, maritime may be faster. But even, you know, they've made a lot of money of recent, but there's been times in the past where they haven't made as much money either. So transportation itself is just got smaller margins. It's got more independent players, smaller players. And so again, I think it'll start with the manufacturing. And then eventually as costs come down, it gets normalized, the data is being exchanged, then it can move to the transportation sector, not that there won't be any transportation companies focused on blockchain and their carbon footprint there will be I just we have to recognize there's lots of independence there's lots of different players, and the margins are different than some of the you know, well, brand name known companies. So

10:01
Okay, excellent. So, so based on so based on, based on what we discussed, what do you think the feasibility would be? And if you do think it's feasible? How long do you think that it would take for Godot, there's gonna be a phased approach where it might be the larger organizations, you know, adopting it, then you have the small and medium organizations. You know, how long do you think it would take? If you think it's feasible?

10:35
Very good question. I don't have the crystal ball, you know, I would assume that you're looking, you know, five years out for manufacturers. Part of the issue, when you look at just the carbon measurement is the lack of agreement on how to measure. So that is going to take another year to two years, just to get people on the same page, you know, what does an audit look like? And maybe one to two years is, is actually optimistic. No one likes, you know, the standard better than their own standard, right. So the idea of countries coming together, and of their being uniformity, you know, how long will that take, what I'm hoping is, we at least come to some basic principles that would allow for measurement, with an understanding that it would be refined, like anything else, and it may have certain amount of allocations to it that isn't necessarily ideal. But you know, if you're making, you know, if you have any product, the core ingredient could be good going into multiple things. So, you know, I think before you were talking briefly about a cow, we are talking about a cow, but, you know, different pieces of that cow are used different ways, right? Sometimes for me, sometimes for the hide, it could be, you know, different uses, and so all products and that, too. So what's it being used for, right? And so there has to be some amount, it's like, overhead cost, you're going to have some amount of allocations that have to happen as part of this. If there can be agreement on how those get done, what's reasonable methodologies, then you're going to talk about the blockchain really being able to come in and be that verification piece. So I'm thinking, three to five years. And that may seem long, but it takes a long time for adoption. And again, it's going to be the big companies, and then the smaller ones over time. Right. And, you know, I think with anything that costs, you know, this will, the big issue will also be how much does this cost? Right? So as costs go down, then it becomes more and more feasible, and the timeline may move up. But that is always it has to have an ROI. People aren't going to do something unless there is a return on the money. They're investing in it. Yep,

13:16
I think, yeah, I think that's the big I think that's the big hang up, in terms of in terms of, you know, just primarily talking about the blockchain, you know, the blockchain technology, you know, you know, artificial intelligence, that's gonna say, organizations a lot of money, but how much is is a blockchain, you know, solution gonna save an organization? You know, I think that some people see it as a detriment, because now I have to show everything. Right. But, you know, we talk a lot about we talk a lot about, you know, the zero knowledge proof. We talked about that at the at the at the event that that, you know, we did at Georgetown, where, you know, we can we can confirm that you're saying that you're saying what you're saying is indeed true, without showing everything, you know, and I think that if Supply Chain Leaders are educated on that, first, I think that we'll have I think we'll have more more acceptance, I won't say embrace. That's the little that's a little that's a little quick. I think that you know, they'll they'll have more acceptance to actually listen to it more. But, you know, I know that I know that we talked about about blockchain and its sustainability class, you know, in terms of I think we have a case study in terms of V chain, this study is actually for V chain. But the you do you have other classes where you talk about, you know, artificial light technologies, such as artificial intelligence and blockchain within a program.

14:40
Oh, absolutely. Sourcing class, right. Strategic Sourcing and contracting. That's been a big topic, both on you know, how will it I think, from a student perspective, it's how will these technologies change my job? How will they change what I need to know? So actually, the last Last time we had, we're talking about both of the technologies, actually. So, you know, and I think you make a good point. And with AI, it's relatively cheap, in many ways, right? Although, we're still. So I think companies are gonna see some savings, anything from reducing the workload on code to, you know, being able to replicate things, we're, we're just at the forefront of what will happen with AI, and they're ready using it for scouting as suppliers, you know, lots of different ways that you can use that to very easily bring back a large amount of information, sort through it. But it's still at this point requires, you know, intervention by humans at some point. When you look at the blockchain, I think that contracts of sizeable amount are important. But I think what you were talking about, you kind of hit the nail on the head with the zero knowledge proof, right? The issue is supply chain, and we talked about this. Everyone wants to know, the tier two, tier three, but your your manufacturers don't necessarily want you to know that or if you're a distributor, let me use it that way. Because maybe you can go around supply chains weren't necessarily built to be fully transparent. Go from the risk of costs getting out there to what are the actual ingredients I'm using, something's proprietary I, you know, I've developed a formula, I don't want anyone to know that formula. And I don't want them to know my suppliers. So we have both, when you're looking at corporate social responsibility, whether it's carbon, whether it's making sure there's not forced labor, no matter what it is, the difficulty lies in the fact that supply chains don't necessarily want you to know all their suppliers. So if you can do something where some pieces hidden, meaning the name of the supplier amounts, maybe not as much price, certainly, right. But if you can hide those things, but have the other pieces verified, without it being Oh, well, I can still figure it out without the name, right. I mean, there's there needs to be a way. And so I think that that can be done. And that would help sort of grease the wheels, if, you know, if it didn't have full transparency. And it may be you know, using permission blockchains at some point to where you get permission to see certain things, right. So it's that that combo, that might happen, I see that in the medical area as being something you know, there's lots of different use cases, we're talking supply chain and carbon right now. But there's obviously lots of different use cases. And even for the, for the carbon and tracking it, maybe it is permissioned, maybe it's not just open and maybe you only get to see it for you know, certain products, you know, same thing, you have to de risk it for the people who are putting the information out there. And to help de risk it, it may mean that some things have to be anonymous. So I know that goes against the transparency piece, but really you're being transparent about a lot part that matters more than the part that doesn't although people who want to use it to see that the tier two or tier three suppliers are financially sound, they do want to know the names, but maybe for carbon, it doesn't matter. All right, so that's where you might have given different pieces of information that can be attributed to the same company

19:04
Yeah, I think he brought he brought up about four good points there. So yeah, cuz like whenever you saw m&s, and that's the whole thing about about you know, different blockchain protocols and that they're going to have their own their benefits you know, their benefits and things like that. So you know, what with V chain you know, V chain was focused on the supply chain industry, right? And you know, and they're doing a lot within the within the carbon tracking space. Now, you do mention you did mention the whole the whole permission blockchain, you know, permission blockchain thing, which is going to be a topic of discussion once we actually get leaders in this space. But then there's another there's another protocol that that has a number of use cases called Casper, so the CASPER protocol. So they're actually you know, they're saying that you know, one of the main industries they're going they're trying to address is a supply chain industry, but they they're called they're, they're referred to as a hybrid blockchain, where you can pick in choose what information you want to be, you know, transparent, and then what information you don't want. But like I said, you know, zero knowledge Proofs will actually give you that, you know, based on certain use cases, but natively Casper is saying that, you know, we're a hybrid blockchain. So, you know, as people as, as organizations, you know, come on to these protocols, then we'll actually kind of hash out these these particular these particular things. So, you know, again, that's going to be on down the line. So, alright, last question. Probably won't be, but I'll say last question. What, what challenges what challenges do you foresee us having in, you know, tracking, tracking, you know, carbon carbon emissions, carbon credits, carbon offsets on, you know, on the blockchain, in your opinion?

20:52
As I've mentioned, just first, the measurability right, and and methodologies. That's the biggest challenge in my mind. And then it's probably secondly is getting who's going to audit? And how are you validating the auditors, so they may need their own credentials that hat lie on the blockchain to to be able to say, yes, I've done X, Y, and Z and this methodology have this level of training away again, that someone can't rubber stamp, so there's going to be some, you know, it's gonna be a cottage industry in a way of just measurement. But then you have to know how how do you validate the people who are measuring this, that they're using the same methodology that they're trained? So I think that could be one of the uses for the blockchain on sustainability as well? And is that a challenge? More that you'll start like anything else with too many, and something has to shake it out? So there needs to be some kind of I don't want to say governing body but at least a group that is agreeing upon the standards, right? The standards that would be implemented for the measurement of the carbon, and who can you know, who's trained in it, who's certified in it? And then the challenge, I think, with it actually going on the blockchain is probably a little bit less other than as we talked about, you know, being able to possibly make some of it anonymous. I mean, I don't see the actual technology piece, once you have the measurement as being that much of a roadblock. I think it's just getting people on the same page for the measurement. And then getting that group, even if you have that, who can now do the certifications. They would maybe be the issuers or utilize the blockchain, you know, to issue that have the ability to do that. And basically say, yes, I've put this on the blockchain because they've LEED certified and this product has this much carbon.

23:08
Excellent. Thank you for that. So yeah, that's all that's all the questions. That's all the questions that I have. So Linda, thanks. Thanks once again. Where can people find you? Where can people learn more about more about your program?

23:23
Thanks, Justin. Yeah, well, I'm on LinkedIn. So feel free to reach out connect with me on LinkedIn. And then the program they can go to Georgetown's website, Georgetown School of Continuing Studies, and there's a little you know, you just click on there and you'll see all about us there and the program and curriculum and faculty. So hope people are you know, it's a great field. The technology that's coming and impacting this field is just amazing to

23:56
yeah, great field,

23:58
great program and you know, you know, you'll

24:01
have a lot of institutions that are you know, very based you know, research based but you know, Georgia Georgetown program is is practice base, you know, they have have a lot of lot of esteemed faculty, they have a strong have strong people on the advisory board, you know, one of my close peers, Sherry Hines is on the advisory board along with with other other, you know, people with, you know, amazing backgrounds, you know, in the public and private sector. So, check it out. So, once again, thank you and everyone else until next time,

VeChain Foundation Climate Research with Dr. Justin Goldston and Tayler McCracken of The Coin Bureau
Video Link - https://youtu.be/AO-PiQSm_NQ

Yeah, thanks again for inviting me back on further chats. So as Justin just said, I work for the coin bureau. I'm one of the researchers and an analyst there. I've been there for a couple years. Prior to the coin Bureau, I've worked in blockchain investigation, I was a quality control analyst for a couple different crypto companies as well. And I'm currently the editor of the Coimbra website. So but I understand the topic that we're going to talk about today is about climate change. Sorry, if I just kind of jumped in for any there and introduce the topic for you got to go into it. But you say the one thing I'm absolutely not, though, is a expert in climate change. So you know, I'm happy to kind of share my opinions and my views of it. But I'll be the first to admit that I am not the most educated on the subject. I do spend a lot of time listening to people who are far more intelligent than me discuss this topic, and form some ideas and opinions outweigh so I do have some thoughts and questions to share. But you know, by no means do I consider myself an expert on this. And by no means do I even have necessarily an opinion one way or another. So I know this is quite a controversial topic. But yeah, so I so I'm just saying, you know, what I hear and what I feel, but I'm always happy to be proven wrong. And have my mind changed. So?

01:35
Yeah. All right. So let's, let's, let's get into it. So I know one of the first things that we want to, that we want to delve into one of the things that we're researching is, is the whole idea of, of organizations tracking carbon emissions on the on the blockchain, I know that we briefly spoke about, we briefly spoke about, you know, Deborah dulls interview right, there was an eye opening to me, you know, and you know, I talk a lot so actually, I was little exposed to some some of the things that she talked about. So So what are your thoughts on on organizations tracking carbon emissions, they didn't happen. They're there things be or their information being transparent on a blockchain?

02:18
So I think it's, it's a good idea to be aware of our impact on the environment, obviously, without a doubt. But one of the things that Deborah brought up, and I think she really nailed it is, it's, it's incredibly difficult to do. And it's something that I think we're going to waste more resources trying to do it and we'll actually be able to, to successfully complete it. So one of the issues right off the bat is there's no globally agreed standard on, you know, these carbon credit like, like they're, how they're, how they're issued and how we're even tracking carbon. So I'm going to kind of steal a bit from what Deborah was saying here. But she brought up a really good point when she was saying, you know, if we want to track the carbon emissions from a supply chain, from point A to point B, there are a lot of things happening between point A to point B, right? So say, say we're hauling livestock, and it's, we have to know what fertilizer we use for that cow to eat? How far do we have to walk that cow from point A to point B to get it on the truck? How many man hours were involved? What about the factory that raises the cattle? Do they leave their lights on overnight? What kind of an energy grid are they using? And then when we get the actual animal on the truck? What kind of truck is it? You know, what's its engine? Is it is it something that is fuel efficient? So there are so many little checkpoints along the way. And then a truck gets to the destination and say it goes into a slaughterhouse, the slaughterhouse again, like what kind of light bulbs are they using? You know, are they just installed these other kinds of these data points to use it and then we have to get that cow then to the grocery store, then to the, you know, humans plates. And so if you kind of think about all those little checkpoints along the way, if we're actually going to go and measure the carbon footprint for every stop along that journey. I'm like, that is an awful lot of resources and manpower. And I think we're going to end up using a lot. We're going to be using more resources and pro and possibly even contributing to a worse carbon footprint, just trying to track the journey from field to plates. So I do think that's quite an issue. Yes, sir. Was that your question?

04:32
Yeah, yeah, that was that was the question and that you have a good point in terms of the tracking and tracing how they're tracking and tracing may be, may be an issue. So So that's just the effort and tracking and tracing it. How are we going to get on the blockchain? How are we gonna get every single one of those business partners to publish our write that information to you know, the blockchain? And yes, we did. Yes. We talked about how you know, the IoT IoT He devices may be able to track that. But that's just one piece of it. You know, that's just the essence logistical portion of it. Now, we're not talking about the, you know, the information, it needs to be tracked by the farmers, you know, what about the what about the methane, the cows, the cows released into the atmosphere and things like,

05:17
exactly do need to start like measuring cows farts and you know, putting in a scoring credit system as well. So it's also and I do think that blockchain has a really powerful potential for supply chain tracking, like we were talking about how they use it during the rollover the vaccines to check, you know, so I think blockchain can be really useful for, you know, tracking the journey from point A to point B, as far as you know, it can relay data such as temperature and location and how long it was stored at the certain checkpoints. And I think things like that, it's quite useful to put those on an on a digital ledger and use blockchain. But as far as actually tracking the emissions that are that's going on in the process. I'm just not sure if we're quite there yet.

06:04
All right. Got it. I appreciate that. So that's the that's, that's,

06:08
that's step one. Right? Yeah, exactly. That's step one.

06:12
So So, in another in another step, you know, what's your thoughts of what's your thoughts of tracking, you know, carbon credits, carbon credits from the blockchain?

06:23
So I carbon credits is another hot topic to write. And so I'm gonna pull from some notes here. But I think the carbon credit idea for anybody who doesn't know it has been shown to be well just quite cropped its own nature. So it was, the idea for them was first kind of rolled out during the Tokyo accord in 1995. And the UN did a study. Got it, like, just read my own notes here. Yeah, the UN ended up doing a study that just basically showed over 75% of the carbon credits issued, there was no, basically they were issued, and nobody knows what even happened with them, like, you know, they just kind of went into the ether, and they just disappear. It's over 75% actually had no impact whatsoever. And then what's even worse than that is they know that Russia and Ukraine were basically using carbon credits for washe trading. And they were actually like, gamifying the system. So one of the things that Russia was caught doing was doing anything, again, with my notes, right, like a doctor. Yeah, so basically, what Russia was doing is they were changing the the basically the, the requirements. So again, this goes back to the fact that there's no agreed issuance of doing this, there's no like globally agreed way of doing it. So basically, what Russia decided to do is they were taking out the CFC and the HF C S, which are greenhouse gases, they were taking the these checks out in 2011. And then basically, they were releasing carbon credits, buying them back. And then they're saying that they were taking the CFCs and HCFCs is out of the environment. And basically, what this was allowing to do was it was allowing companies to increase their carbon outputs. And because they weren't tracking the harmful portions of it, right. So I probably I'm not really smart enough to understand what all that means. But yeah, so basically, they were just gamifying the system, they were making millions. And I want to give credit to a there's a really brilliant YouTube video from Belinda Carr. And she basically pulls up 10 Key instances that it's, you know, it's been verified how the carbon credits system has been quite corrupt. And I think I'm not going to go through a whole video, but I think one of my favorite things that she really kind of puts it into the ground is she brings up a use case of an oil tanker. It's a French company. And basically what they're doing is they're pulling natural gas in the ground in Australia, hauling it over to China. And you know, that's using a hell of a lot of carbon. And then what they did is they turned around, and they invested in a 10 year old wind farm in China. And then also they were claiming that they were net, like net carbon zero. And she's like, I'm sorry, she's like, having, like wind power does not directly translate to offsetting carbon, she's like, those are two very different things, like you released a lot of like carbon into the air. And just by investing into a wind farm, that that's not negating the damage that was done. So one of one of my biggest personal issues with these carbon credits is we're basically allowing companies to pollute more if they're willing to buy these credits. And we already know that these credits are going towards tree farms where the trees aren't even being planted. In some cases, there's been a you know, a couple of companies get in trouble for that. They're claiming they're planting trees that they're not. And legally these trees can be cut down after 10 years. So say you're dumping loads of carbon into the atmosphere with and you're buying these carbon credits or going to planting trees. Also, they can just cut these tree down these trees down after 10 years. So I kind of think this is similar to, you know, if you've got a bucket full of water and you're punching a bunch of holes in the bucket and you're patching the holes, and it's like, well, when it a bit just been better if you didn't punch the holes in the bucket in the first place. You know, if you truly cared about the environment, you shouldn't just be basically, it's almost like a form of bribery. It's a way of paying these companies extra money to just let you pollute as much as you want. So I think the carbon credits are a bit of a, it is a bit of a scam. Something else actually Deborah has, she makes a really good point in her note, as well as, again, the lack of global standards. So Delta airline pays $2.30 per ton for their carbon emissions, Microsoft pays $20 per ton. And Bill, you're sorry, 2 million and Bill Gates pays 600 million. So it's like so why is Bill Gates having to pay far more than, say, delta? So like, if we're all polluting the same way, then why isn't there more of a standard across the board? So there's just a lot of yeah, there's just too many inconsistencies for my liking. And the fact that people are speculating on these as well, that really kind of bothers me, it's, um, if our goal is to do what's better for the planet, then why are we using carbon credits to speculative asset as well, we're using them to buy trade sell profit from like, ultimately, the these bloody things are being used to, yeah, invest in buy sell homes on life. So you're not really caring about the problem, you're caring about using these carbon credits as another speculative assets. And furthermore, is this kind of ties into this ESG narrative as well. And it's, it's politics and corporations that are trying to dictate the way that we're supposed to be healing the planet, right. And I'm like, and the majority of us are for profit companies and enterprises that are trying to play by this set of rules. And for me, personally, I'm like, if I sit down in a room with 50, scientists who understands the way the planet works, and you know, they've studied the environment things, and if they tell me, they're like, you know, this is what's best for the environment, I'm going to be inclined to believe them. But a bunch of, you know, been in business suits from companies and for profit corporations trying to tell me, Hey, we can fix the planet, while simultaneously patting their bank account, that raises some red flags for me, because they're not doing things if it's not in their best interest, right. And that's the money's always the bottom line. So I'm skeptical of the entities that are behind these narratives as well. And it's not just me sounding like crazy person here. I mean, there's been a few states in the US who have openly rallied against this, you know, ESG investment movement as well. And the governor of Florida is, you know, he's actually proposing like, anti ESG bills and things like that. Because, yeah, it's just been shown to be a flight model. So I'm not saying that nothing needs to be done about it. But I don't think carbon credits are the way to go. Maybe carbon offsets could be could be an idea. But again, these are questions for people way smarter than me to kind of figure out

13:11
okay, how do they how do they say it? How they say it shots fired?

13:18
I just want to humble man's opinion, and crazy rants on the internet.

13:23
But so I actually saw why you were Yeah, so I actually got I think I got that so exposing the carbon credit and offset scam and the one from Belinda car because there's two Yes. So

13:31
So um, yeah, but Belinda car, she she puts it far more eloquently than I do. But yeah, she just basically has one called Carbon Credit scam. And even if you just Google carbon credit scam, there's a lot of really good advice. And it's not even just theories, it's, you know, like the UN has found this through their investigations and things like that, that. Yeah, the vast majority of these things aren't doing what they claim to do. Got it is it's a bit of a shame. And and I don't know if it was set up. I mean, I would imagine it was set up with good intentions, but it's just like anything, it's been gamified. I mean, it's and people will do with everything, right? Like I use, I'm a big fan of this one crypto app where you basically get crypto for walking, and people hook it up to a drill and just spin a drill and they just get free and you know, so it's like this app came out with good intentions, like, let's get people fit, let's get people moving. And this guy was like, Nah, was Sweatcoin. And this guy's like, I'm just gonna hook it up to a drill. And it's like, so people are always gonna find ways to mess with the system, right?

14:32
Yeah, I still I still get notifications from Sweatcoin like three times a day about things, you know. So, but you mentioned that So you mentioned that, that there could be a potential solution for carbon offsets. Can you expand expand on that a little bit?

14:47
Yeah, I think so. So again, I'm far from an expert in the space but basically, there is a difference between carbon credits and carbon offsets and carbon credits is basically paying more so you can pollute more in a sense and you can Basically trade these things. So if you have extra carbon credits leftover, sell them whatever. But what carbon offsets are, is actually trying to have more of like a direct impact. So you can capture methane and you can use it for fuel. And just do things like lower energy usage and invest in renewable energy and things like that. So it's things that more have like a direct impact. So companies can actually say, you know, instead of using electricity, we're now going to move to a solar panel. And there are there are benefits and incentives in place to do things like that. But I think some of the most impactful ones, again, we've seen with Bitcoin miners, so you know, they're taking flared gas that would otherwise be wasted, it's in the atmosphere polluting as well. And so instead of that, just going in the atmosphere, Bitcoin miners are now actually able to grab that. And that would be a form of carbon offsetting, because they're offsetting what would be polluting, and they're putting it to use to create Bitcoin. A lot of people do with things like methane is a big one for various different uses. So I think, I think what's might happen with carbon that that I would quite like to see is maybe not even trying to reduce it, maybe just find an alternate use for it, you know, like, so instead of just letting it go in the complaint, let's, let's caption let's do something with it. Because I mean, you know, you and I are carbon plastic is carbon. So, you know, instead of just wasting it, let's, let's maybe find a use for it. I mean, again, these these are questions and things for other people to kind of figure out but yeah, so that kind of my two cents is, let's resolve the problem, not just just throw money at it right. And just go on another little bit of a tangent here is I do think by us trying to use blockchain technology, you're getting too much enjoyment out of this. So I, there's a an old cliche talks about bring the cars the the horse before the buggy, right? And I think blockchain has a tendency to that as well. So I'm obviously I'm a huge fan of blockchain technology, I think it can do some incredible things. But I think one of the things that V chain is trying to do is solve a problem that we don't even understand yet. There's no scientific consensus on what the problem actually is. And you know, when we think about climate change, so many people that just default to Yeah, the Earth is getting hotter. But it's actually a very complex, multifaceted problem. It's. So you know, they stopped calling it global warming. Now, it's climate change. And it's like, are we looking at this from a precipitation perspective? Are we talking about this from a temperature perspective, because in different parts of the world, there's all sorts of different things going on, you know, there's flooding in one area and droughts and elsewhere, like we've never seen before. You know, we're breaking high temperatures, low temperatures, and there's a lot more going on than just just heating. And, and one thing that worries me about this is when the scientific community can't come up to a with, with a consensus on like, how can we understand what's going on or, or try and solve it when we don't even we can't even agree on what the problem is. So I met to grab the name of an interesting TED Talk. But basically, there was a guy that was studying our impact on the environment. I'll get the name too after this. And basically, he made a very revolutionary discovery. And he actually found that one of the problems is just the fact that we are corralling livestock and keeping them in one area. So he did an experiment in Africa where he was actually like, let's just let livestock just roam roam freely. And that was his solution. And and the effects were quite incredible, really. So basically, because the animals were walking, and they were, you know, their feces and urine were spreading all over it completely regenerated areas of the desert where they thought it's too arid, nothing can grow as soon and so it's, you know, a lot of scientists are like, we need less cows, less cattle, less methane. And this guy's will like, Well, wait a minute, he's like, I just put this real profit or in real practice. He's like, I just put more cows more methane, more livestock in the fields. And it's actually regenerating the planet, and regenerating greenery and stuff. So I think the thing with with climate change is it's like we need a consensus. We need to understand a problem before we can tackle it. So whether or not crypto or blockchain is the solution, I don't know. But I heard something that I quite liked the other day and I kind of related to this issue here is they're talking about blockchain gaming, and they're saying that one of the problems with crypto is on blockchain in general is we do have the potential to solve so many problems. But maybe we're not the right people to be doing it. So you saw me like crypto gaming, and the reason why crypto gaming is so cool crap, is because it's people in crypto trying to create video games. It's the wrong way around. He's like the video game community doesn't need crypto. Crypto needs the video game community to adopt it. And I kind of think about that with what the chicken is trying to do as well. It's first and foremost are a technology company. What do they know about climate change? I mean, maybe they know a lot and I know that they do some work. With the UN, and I'm sure they've got some brilliant advisors on board. But I think Kryptos focus should be on all blockchain sorry, is they should just be building the tools. And you know the potential and then basically its existing industry should be integrating blockchain into what they do. So ideally, what I would like to see is, again, I want to see this lead this initiative to say the world should be led from an academic and a scientific perspective. It shouldn't be being ran from UN, from politicians from businesses, corporations, it shouldn't be a blockchain company. So you know, I'd like to see if, if the scientific community realizes you're like, hey, we can use blockchain technology to help with our golden grades. But I do find it a bit weird that it's V chain being like, hey, let's save the planet. And it's like, Well, wait, you guys were a crypto company? Like, let's Yeah, so I think it might be a bit skewed. So yeah, just need to understand the problem. I think first and foremost,

21:00
interesting. Interesting. So So you met you met you brought up? You brought up a you brought up a good, good point. And it made me think of another thing and in terms of so you said that the cow, the cow TED talk, and I want I want to get that one, by the way. Yeah, I'll send it to you. That one sounds great. But so you said it was regenerating, regenerating, you know, the areas, you know, the arid areas. So what's your thoughts on? What's your thoughts on on this whole refile movement? We're starting to hear we're starting to hear about within the web three space. And my second question, my follow up question is going to be based on your response.

21:39
Okay, no, I mean, I think that, again, it's the intentions I guess, and I now I'm just going to completely contradict myself. Because I like to see it. I do. Um, I kind of give a pretty corny answer. But when people ask me what my favorite blockchain project is, I often say whatever, whatever ones trying to have the best impact on the planet. So So I mean, I'll get behind any blockchain project that seems like they can make life better they can make, you know the world better, which I, you know, I realized that that's kind of contradicting what I've just previously said about why are crypto companies trying to do everything? But I mean, I think it's a good first step. And so yeah, if a crypto company thinks maybe they can take a crack at something, and they can make the world a better place, then I mean, go for it. I mean, you've got, you know, I'll stand by on the sidelines, and I'll cheer you on with the flag. And, you know, I hope they come with something groundbreaking, something revolutionary, but I don't see it coming from the crypto community, I think, I think it's got to come from the traditional and I think it has to be traditional industry who are experts in that industry in that niche, and they're gonna have to adopt crypto into their world, I don't see how it could be the other way around. So you know, the saving the planet thing? I mean, are you a blockchain developer? Or are you an ecologist? I mean, if you're both awesome, brilliant. And if you can work together, then yeah, great, but it's not some crypto bros can't save the world. You know, it's, we need some some traditional experts in these fields. For sure.

23:14
Yeah. I love it. I love it, as you can tell, but alright, so basically, based on that answer, what do you think the implementation strategy would be? In order to successfully implement a solution that would save the planet? With these protocols? I know you I know, you'd briefly touched on it. But you know, what? Thoughts?

23:44
Yeah, so I think that's a tricky one. So I think, um, the traditional pillars are already in place, there's already people working on on these, you know, solutions and trying to, you know, to Greenify the planet and make it a better place. So, I guess I kind of see it, if I have to kind of picture in my mind. It's, it's basically it's like, the tech is running along this real way. And then, you know, if we're talking about, you know, to make things simple, it's like, well, bringing down global temperatures. So there are people working on that along this, this, you know, linear path, and then there are people working on the tech on on this side of the path, and at some point, they're going to have to merge. But I think, yeah, I mean, how they're going to integrate. I mean, like, I guess they're gonna have to build the tools, the tech guys, you're gonna have to build tools, and then the people in the real world industries are gonna have to see if they can adopt these tools to help with their mission. I guess what it's gonna come down to.

24:41
Yeah, yeah. And but, like I said, like you said, it's already there. But I think the I think the bottleneck is the education piece. Yes, I might be biased, but I think it's the education piece where, you know, the scientists and the real people that understand the problems they don't understand and You know, Blockchain, you know. So I think that and I don't really think about I didn't really realize this until you actually explained it. So I think that I mean, we always talk about, we always talk about, oh, we need to educate the onboarding, to educate to, to get the wide adoption. But whenever we say educate, we're talking about educating people and setting up wallets and things like that, you know, you make an excellent point in that we need to educate the scientists, we need to educate the academics, on what the on what the potential is for the certain blockchain because like you said, they see blockchain is creating basically blockchain is Aetherium. And Bitcoin, you know, there's hundreds of there's hundreds of other blockchain blevet layer one, layer two is to, you know, block chains out there that are there for certain use cases. You know, you know, you got, you got the beat chains, you got the cellos, you got the, you know, you got the algorithm, that's, that's looking to make a positive impact on the planet, you know, Hadera hash graph, who are who are looking to we're focused on on this sustainability aspect, you know, but even us within the web three space, we can't keep up with them all, you know, so, so So, I mean, I think that, you know, the education from the technology is going to be is going to be a step that I don't think that many people were actually looking at. I mean, there's too much going yes, there's a lot going on, not too much. There's a lot going on in this space. But you know, I think that you know, education needs to be it needs needs to be closer look needs to be taken into it that if we're going to achieve what we're trying to achieve in a study like this, or in the study, like the other interview you did with financial literacy.

26:38
No, absolutely. And again, I think we're the topic with the environment is I think, again, there has to be consensus among, you know, the scientific community, we have to understand you can't solve the problem if you don't know what the problem is. So it's, you know, first thing I do think we have to understand what the problem is and then the best way to go forward with fixing it. But you know, you might find this a bit interesting this is something I really kind of blew me away with how education and academia is kind of intertwining with Blockchain is I got to attend this absolutely brilliant conference. It was held in Germany I was I dialed in remotely and you know, if I think like environmental stuff is over my head, this was from the medical community so it was professors from different German universities. Watch, sir was universities all over the world, but they were actually using and, and stuff like this will amaze me because I cover a lot of like, video game crypto projects, and like things that are fairly like low, I mean, highly entertaining level, but fairly low impact. And what this conference was all about is how geneticists are using the Ethereum blockchain. And I'm probably going to completely butcher this because this was all pretty high level stuff, and I'm sitting or trying to take notes. You know, like a kindergartener scribbling with a crayon. But basically, they were using Blockchain technology in a way to glow to globally collaborate on the study of genetic deformities and people. And the reason why, and you know, one of the things is people are always the ones who have to be on the blockchain, just use a database. But they were using like Zika roll ups and things in a way. That's basically what this allowed to do, because there's always Doctor client confidentiality. So you can't just share things globally. So basically, they were studying genetic deformities, and collaborating on it globally. And, and because they were using a theory and blockchain technology they were or something. But basically, it allowed all these different members of the scientific community to look at the same case study without exposing confidential information about the patients. And you know, look at the history, and there are actually quite a few different use cases. And that was the first the first real eye opener for me and I was about a year ago. And that was the first real eye opener for me, I was like, man, it's crypto is about more than just finance. I mean, Blockchain is about a lot more than just finance and, you know, monkey pictures. It's, it's making a fundamental impact on you know, the medical community. And hopefully, we'll see the, the the greenhouse gas issue. Hopefully, it'll solve all sorts of problems.

29:04
Yeah, that's one thing. That's one thing I keep talking about from a supply chain perspective, where organizations don't want to show everything you know, across their supply chain networks, you know, and I think that zero knowledge proofs are going to have a massive impact once organizations began to adopt to adopt a solution. So So that's, that's all I saw what questions that I had. I know we went this one went a little long, and I love it. So Tyler, do you have any you have anything else you want to share?

29:35
No, I mean, I'll get that info over to you. And yeah, we'll keep in touch. I'm really interested, the work you're doing and stuff. So I'm definitely gonna, you know, give you a follow and buggy every couple of weeks you're up to? Absolutely. So

29:47
where can everyone find you?

29:49
Yeah, so obviously at the coin Bureau, you can find me there. I'm not very active on LinkedIn. I am on there, but I'm pretty active on Twitter, just at Taylor TBM. And that's Taylor with an E So if you want to I drop some ridiculous memes and hopefully some interesting crypto tidbits of information

30:07
all right thank you thanks again for coming on and everyone else until next time
